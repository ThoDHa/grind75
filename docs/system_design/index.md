# System Design: Start Here

The coding rounds test whether you can solve a well-defined problem. The
system design round tests something different: whether you can take a vague,
open-ended prompt ("design a chat app") and turn it into a concrete
architecture through a series of *reasoned tradeoffs*. There is no single
correct answer, and the interviewer is not checking whether you know a
specific technology. They are watching how you think when nothing is given.

This section is a **scaffold, not a finished course**. It gives you a
repeatable method, the arithmetic to size a system out loud, the vocabulary of
standard components, and guided case studies with deliberate gaps for you to
fill. Expect it to grow: the case study roadmap lists designs that are planned
but not yet written.

## What the round actually tests

- **Tradeoff reasoning, not trivia.** "SQL or NoSQL?" is never the question.
  "What does this workload need, and what are you willing to give up to get
  it?" always is. Saying "Cassandra" earns nothing; explaining *why*
  write-heavy, partition-friendly data tolerates eventual consistency earns a
  lot.
- **Structured thinking under ambiguity.** The prompt is vague on purpose.
  Strong candidates narrow it with questions before drawing anything.
- **Quantitative sanity.** You will be expected to estimate load and storage
  with rough numbers and to notice when a design cannot possibly handle the
  math you just did.
- **Communication.** The round is a conversation. Interviewers steer, and
  following their steering is graded.

## How this section is organized

| Guide | What it gives you | Read it when |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| [The Interview Method](method.md) | A repeatable 6-step framework with a time budget for a 45-minute round | First: everything else plugs into it |
| [Back-of-Envelope Estimation](estimation.md) | Latency numbers, powers of two, QPS and storage arithmetic, worked examples | Second: step 2 of the method depends on it |
| [Building Blocks](building_blocks.md) | The component vocabulary: load balancers, caches, databases, queues, and the rest | Third, or as a reference while doing case studies |
| [Case Studies](case_studies/index.md) | Four guided workthroughs (URL shortener, rate limiter, news feed, chat) with answers hidden behind collapsible blocks | Last: this is where the method becomes muscle memory |

## A suggested study path

1. Read [The Interview Method](method.md) and internalize the 6 steps
   (about 1 hour).
2. Work through [Back-of-Envelope Estimation](estimation.md) with a pen.
   Redo the worked examples yourself before opening the traces (2 to 3
   hours, mostly practice).
3. Read [Building Blocks](building_blocks.md) once end to end, then treat it
   as a reference (2 to 3 hours).
4. Do the four [case studies](case_studies/index.md) *actively*: attempt each
   prompt yourself before opening the collapsed answers, and finish the
   "extend this scaffold" checklist for at least one of them (2 to 3 hours
   each, so 8 to 12 hours total).
5. Repeat a case study cold a week later, out loud, with a 45-minute timer.
   Talking through a design is a different skill from reading one.

That is roughly 15 to 20 hours for a solid baseline. Senior-level depth comes
from extending the scaffolds and from reading about real systems, not from
rereading these pages.

## How this complements the DSA sections

The [How to Approach a Problem](../foundations/how_to_approach.md) guide is
this section's sibling: both replace blank-page panic with a checklist. The
mindset transfers directly. In a coding round you restate the problem, walk
examples, write the brute force, then optimize. In a design round you clarify
requirements, estimate, sketch the simple architecture, then deepen it where
the numbers or the interviewer demand. In both cases the first version is
deliberately simple, and the improvement is justified by identified cost, not
by reflex.

The DSA knowledge also shows up directly: hash-based sharding is
[hashing](../patterns/hashing/intuition.md) at datacenter scale, an LRU cache
is a Grind75 problem *and* a production component, and rate limiters are
sliding windows over time instead of arrays.

## Seniority expectations, honestly

Interviewers calibrate the same prompt differently by level. Knowing the bar
keeps you from over- or under-preparing.

| Level | What passes | What is not yet expected |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Junior / new grad | A reasonable set of components wired together sensibly: a load balancer, app servers, a database, a cache, with correct data flow and honest estimation | Deep failure analysis, exotic components, defending consistency choices under fire |
| Mid-level | All of the above, plus correct choices *with reasons*: why this partition key, why a queue here, what breaks first under 10x load | Designing for problems the interviewer has not raised |
| Senior / staff | Deep tradeoffs and failure handling: what happens when the cache dies, how the system degrades, migration paths, consistency guarantees stated precisely, and pushing back on requirements when they conflict | Nothing is off the table; the interviewer will probe until they find the edge of your knowledge, which is normal |

At every level, the fastest way to fail is the same: silence, hand-waved
numbers, or ignoring the interviewer's steering. The method exists to prevent
all three.

## This section is growing

The four case studies are scaffolded workthroughs with intentional gaps, and
the [roadmap](case_studies/index.md#roadmap-case-studies-not-yet-written)
lists classics that are not yet written. If a topic you need is missing, the
building blocks page plus the method are usually enough to attempt it
yourself, which is better practice anyway.
