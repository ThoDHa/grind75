# Building Blocks

This is the component vocabulary of system design: what each standard piece
does, what it costs, and when to reach for it. Read it once end to end, then
use it as a reference during [case studies](case_studies/index.md). Every
block ends with the interview question it exists to answer, because that is
how the knowledge gets used: not recited, but deployed when the interviewer
pushes on a box in your diagram.

A component only belongs in your design if a requirement or a number from
[estimation](estimation.md) justifies it. Vocabulary is not a shopping list.

## Load balancers

A load balancer spreads incoming requests across a pool of identical
servers, which is what makes "just add more servers" possible at all. It
also quietly provides the first layer of fault tolerance: health checks pull
dead servers out of rotation.

```
            ┌────────────┐        ┌────────┐
 clients ──▶│  load       │──────▶│ app 1  │
            │  balancer   │──────▶│ app 2  │   health checks:
            │             │───X──▶│ app 3  │◀── failed, removed
            └────────────┘        └────────┘
```

The distinction worth knowing:

| | Layer 4 (transport) | Layer 7 (application) |
|--|--------------------|------------------------|
| Sees | IPs and ports, TCP/UDP | Full HTTP: paths, headers, cookies |
| Can do | Fast, dumb spreading of connections | Route `/api/video` to the video pool, sticky sessions, TLS termination |
| Cost | Very little; millions of connections | More CPU per request, more configuration |

Common spreading policies: round robin, least connections, and hashing on a
key (client IP, user id) when you need the same client to keep landing on
the same server. Server-side state is what makes that stickiness necessary,
which is why stateless app servers are the default advice: any server can
take any request, and scaling and failure both get easy.

**The interview question this answers:** "You said add more servers. How do
requests find them, and what happens when one dies?"

## Caching

A cache is fast memory in front of a slow store, and it works for the same
reason [hashing](../patterns/hashing/intuition.md) works: pay memory to stop
redoing lookups. At system scale the payoff is huge because real traffic is
skewed: a small hot set absorbs most reads (see the
[cache sizing example](estimation.md#example-2-cache-sizing-with-the-8020-rule)).

Where a cache goes matters less than how it stays correct. The three write
policies:

| Policy | How it works | Tradeoff |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Cache-aside | App reads cache; on miss, reads DB and fills cache. Writes go to DB and *invalidate* the cache entry | Default choice. Simple; first read after a write is a miss; brief staleness possible |
| Write-through | Writes go to cache, cache writes to DB synchronously | Cache never stale; every write pays double latency |
| Write-back | Writes go to cache only; flushed to DB later in batches | Fastest writes; a crashed cache node *loses data*, so only for loss-tolerant counters and the like |

Eviction: memory is finite, so something must go. **LRU** (evict the least
recently used) is the standard answer and a Grind75 problem in its own
right; LFU and TTL-based expiry are the common variants. TTLs also double as
a staleness bound: "cached for at most 60 seconds" is a consistency
statement product people can approve.

Two failure patterns to name before the interviewer does:

- **Thundering herd / cache stampede.** A hot key expires, and 10,000
  concurrent requests all miss and hit the database at once. Fixes: request
  coalescing (only one request refills, the rest wait), slightly randomized
  TTLs so keys do not expire in unison, and serving the stale value while
  one request refreshes it.
- **Cold cache.** A restarted cache has a 0% hit rate, and the database
  suddenly sees traffic it has not felt in months. Warm caches gradually or
  shed load while the hit rate recovers.

**The interview question this answers:** "Your read QPS is 100x your write
QPS. What do you do, and what breaks when the cache fails?"

## Databases

### SQL vs NoSQL, framed honestly

The honest framing is not "old vs new" or "slow vs fast". It is: what does
your data look like, and which guarantees are you willing to pay for?

| | Relational (Postgres, MySQL) | NoSQL (DynamoDB, Cassandra, Mongo, ...) |
|--|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Data model | Tables, joins, foreign keys | Key-value, document, or wide-column; joins are your problem |
| Transactions | ACID across rows and tables | Usually limited (per-item or per-partition) |
| Query flexibility | Ad-hoc queries, aggregations | Efficient only along access paths you designed for |
| Scaling story | Excellent vertically and with read replicas; *sharding is manual and painful* | Horizontal partitioning is the native design |
| Schema | Enforced up front | Flexible, enforced by application code |

Two corrections to popular myths, worth saying in an interview:

- A single well-provisioned Postgres or MySQL instance with read replicas
  comfortably serves *most businesses that will ever exist*. Tens of
  thousands of QPS on one primary is normal. "We might need scale someday"
  does not justify giving up joins and transactions today.
- NoSQL is not schemaless in practice; the schema moves into your code, and
  the query model moves into your table design. You trade up-front rigidity
  for the obligation to know your access patterns in advance.

Default honestly stated: start relational; reach for NoSQL when a specific
table's write volume or size exceeds a single primary and its natural
partition key is obvious (events, messages, feeds).

### Replication

Replication keeps copies of the data on multiple nodes, for two distinct
reasons: surviving a node's death, and serving more reads.

```
            writes                reads
              │                     │
              ▼                     ▼
         ┌─────────┐   async   ┌─────────┐
         │ primary │──────────▶│ replica │  (and more replicas)
         └─────────┘  log ship └─────────┘
```

Single-leader replication (one primary takes writes, replicas follow) is
the workhorse. The two costs to know:

- **Replication lag.** With asynchronous replication a replica is slightly
  behind. A user who writes and then reads from a replica may not see their
  own write. Fixes: read-your-own-writes routing (send that user's reads to
  the primary briefly) or synchronous replication, which trades write
  latency for freshness.
- **Failover.** When the primary dies, a replica must be promoted, and
  deciding *which* node and *when* without splitting the brain is exactly
  the problem consensus solves (below).

### Sharding / partitioning

When one machine cannot hold the data or the write load, you split the data
across machines by some key. Each strategy has a characteristic pain:

| Strategy | How | The pain |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Range (by key ranges, e.g. A-F, G-M) | Easy range scans | Hot ranges: new users, recent timestamps all land on one shard |
| Hash (hash(key) mod N) | Even spread | Range queries scatter to all shards; resharding moves nearly everything |
| Consistent hashing (hash ring) | Even spread *and* adding a node moves only ~1/N of keys | More machinery; still no range queries |
| Directory (lookup service maps key to shard) | Total flexibility | The directory is itself a component that can fail and must scale |

The deeper pains are strategy-independent, and naming them is senior-level
signal: cross-shard queries and transactions become slow or impossible, a
bad partition key creates one hot shard doing all the work (a celebrity
user, a viral post), and resharding a live system is a migration project,
not a config change. The partition key is the single most consequential
schema decision in a sharded design: it must match the dominant access
pattern ("all messages for a conversation live on one shard").

**The interview question this answers:** "This table gets 50,000 writes per
second and holds 100 TB. Now what?"

## Message queues and streams

A queue decouples the component that produces work from the one that does
it. The producer enqueues and moves on; consumers process at their own pace;
the queue absorbs bursts.

```
 producers ──▶ [ ▒▒▒▒▒ queue ▒▒▒▒▒ ] ──▶ consumer pool
   (fast, spiky)     buffers            (steady, scalable)
```

What a queue buys you: burst absorption (write spikes become a longer queue
instead of an outage), retries and dead-letter handling for failed work,
independent scaling of producers and consumers, and fan-out of one event to
many consumers. What it costs: the work is now *asynchronous*, so the caller
gets "accepted" rather than "done", and you must design for the delay.

Delivery guarantees, because interviewers love this: **at-least-once** is
the practical default, which means duplicates happen, which means consumers
must be **idempotent** (processing the same message twice is harmless).
Exactly-once end to end is not achievable in general across arbitrary
systems; what frameworks sell as exactly-once is at-least-once delivery
plus deduplication or transactional processing. Saying that sentence
correctly is worth a lot.

Queues (RabbitMQ, SQS) delete a message once consumed. **Streams / logs**
(Kafka, Kinesis) instead keep an ordered, replayable log that many consumer
groups read at their own positions; ordering holds *per partition*, not
globally. Reach for a stream when multiple systems need the same events, or
when replay matters (rebuilding a cache, backfilling analytics).

**The interview question this answers:** "Uploads spike to 20x normal for
one hour a day. Do you provision 20x the workers?"

## CDNs

A content delivery network caches content on servers physically near users.
It exists because of the physics in the
[latency table](estimation.md#the-latency-numbers): a user in Sydney is 200
ms round trip from a Virginia datacenter, and no amount of clever code
changes the speed of light. A CDN edge node 5 ms away serves the cached copy
instead, and as a bonus your origin only sees the misses.

Best for static, shared content: images, video, JS/CSS, and (increasingly)
cacheable API responses. The design questions that come with it: cache
invalidation (versioned URLs like `app.3f2a1.js` sidestep it entirely: new
content gets a new URL), TTL choice, and what fraction of traffic the CDN
absorbs (a 90%+ hit rate for media is normal, and it turns the
[bandwidth math](estimation.md#bandwidth-math) from impossible to routine).

**The interview question this answers:** "Your users are global and your
servers are in one region. Why is the app slow in Australia, and what do you
do about it?"

## Object storage

Object storage (S3, GCS, and friends) stores immutable blobs by key, with
effectively unlimited capacity, extreme durability (eleven nines is the
usual claim, meaning loss is designed to be a once-in-geologic-time event),
and modest latency. It is not a filesystem and not a database: no partial
updates, no queries, just put/get/delete by key.

The standard pattern: **the database stores metadata and a pointer; the
blob lives in object storage; the CDN serves it.** Uploads and downloads go
*directly* between the client and object storage using presigned URLs, so
the bytes never flow through your app servers, which would otherwise be an
expensive, pointless proxy.

The [storage walkthrough](estimation.md#storage-sizing-a-walkthrough) shows
why this split is forced: media is petabytes while metadata is terabytes,
three orders of magnitude apart, and they have completely different access
patterns.

**The interview question this answers:** "Where do the photos actually live,
and does an upload really need to pass through your API servers?"

## Consistency models

Once data is replicated, "what does a read return?" becomes a real
question. The two ends of the spectrum:

- **Strong consistency:** every read reflects the latest completed write,
  as if there were one copy. Costs coordination on every operation: higher
  latency, lower availability.
- **Eventual consistency:** replicas converge given time; a read may be
  stale for a bit. Cheap and fast, and completely fine for like counts,
  view counters, and feeds; unacceptable for account balances and inventory
  you can oversell.

Useful middle grounds exist and are worth naming: **read-your-own-writes**
(a user always sees their own actions, everyone else can lag) and
**monotonic reads** (a user never sees time go backwards). Most products
need one of these, not full strong consistency, and knowing that is exactly
the kind of tradeoff the round is probing for.

**CAP, stated correctly:** when a network partition happens in a replicated
system, you must choose between consistency (refuse some requests rather
than serve possibly stale data) and availability (keep answering, accepting
staleness or conflicts). Partition tolerance is not an optional third
feature to trade away: partitions are a fact of networks, so the *only*
choice CAP gives you is C or A, *during* a partition. In normal operation
the sharper tradeoff is latency vs consistency: coordinating replicas on
every write costs round trips even when nothing is broken.

**The interview question this answers:** "User A posts a comment and user B
does not see it for two seconds. Is that a bug? What in your design decides
that?"

## Consensus, in one paragraph

Consensus protocols (Raft, Paxos) let a cluster of unreliable machines
agree on one value or one ordered log despite crashes, so long as a
majority of nodes are up and can talk. What that buys you in practice: safe
**leader election** (exactly one primary after a failover, never two nodes
both believing they are in charge), and strongly consistent metadata stores
(etcd, ZooKeeper) that everything else can hang coordination on: locks,
configuration, shard maps. In an interview you almost never design a
consensus protocol; you *point* at one: "failover is handled by a
Raft-based coordinator, so promotion is safe and split-brain is excluded."
The cost is majority round trips, which is why you run consensus over small
metadata, not over your data path.

**The interview question this answers:** "The primary dies. Who decides
which replica takes over, and why can't two replicas both decide it's
them?"

## Rate limiting

A rate limiter caps how many requests a client may make in a window,
protecting the system from abuse, runaway clients, and honest overload. The
two algorithms worth knowing cold:

- **Token bucket.** A bucket holds up to `B` tokens and refills at `r`
  tokens/second; each request spends one token, and an empty bucket means
  rejection (or queueing). Allows short bursts up to `B` while enforcing
  the long-run rate `r`, with O(1) state per client: a count and a
  timestamp. This is the industry default.
- **Sliding window.** A fixed window ("100 requests per minute, reset on
  the minute") is simple but allows 2x bursts straddling the boundary. The
  sliding window log keeps a timestamp per request for exactness at O(n)
  memory; the sliding window *counter* approximates by weighting the
  previous window's count by its remaining overlap, which is accurate
  enough and O(1).

At scale the interesting question is not the algorithm but where the
counters live: per-node limits are cheap but a client can shop across
nodes; a shared store (Redis) gives global limits at the cost of a network
hop on every request. This tension gets a full treatment in the
[rate limiter case study](case_studies/rate_limiter.md).

**The interview question this answers:** "One misbehaving client is sending
50,000 requests per second. How do you protect everyone else?"

## Observability

You cannot operate what you cannot see, and interviewers increasingly probe
for this in wrap-up. The three pillars, each answering a different
question:

| Pillar | Answers | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Metrics | "Is the system healthy, in aggregate?" | p99 latency, error rate, queue depth, cache hit rate |
| Logs | "What exactly happened in this case?" | Structured events with request ids |
| Traces | "Where did this request's 800 ms go?" | One request's path across services, with per-hop timing |

Two habits that mark an experienced answer: quote **percentiles, not
averages** (an average of 50 ms hides the p99 of 2 seconds that your
heaviest users hit on every request), and alert on **symptoms users feel**
(error rate, latency) rather than causes (CPU), because causes without
symptoms are not incidents. Health checks and dashboards for queue depth
and replication lag are how the failure modes named elsewhere on this page
actually get caught.

**The interview question this answers:** "You've shipped it. How do you
know it's working, and what pages you at 3 a.m.?"
