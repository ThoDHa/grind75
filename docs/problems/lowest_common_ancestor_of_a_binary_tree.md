Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`, `p = 5`, `q = 1`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes `5` and `1` is `3`.

### Example 2

**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`, `p = 5`, `q = 4`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes `5` and `4` is `5`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### Example 3

**Input:** `root = [1,2]`, `p = 1`, `q = 2`

**Output:** `1`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Solutions

### Find Root-to-Node Paths

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # Collect the chain of nodes from root down to a target.
        def find_path(node, target, path):
            if not node:
                return False
            path.append(node)
            if node is target:
                return True
            if find_path(node.left, target, path) or find_path(node.right, target, path):
                return True
            # This node leads nowhere useful, so drop it before backtracking.
            path.pop()
            return False

        path_p, path_q = [], []
        find_path(root, p, path_p)
        find_path(root, q, path_q)

        # Walk both paths from the root in lockstep; the last shared node is the LCA.
        lca = root
        for a, b in zip(path_p, path_q):
            if a is b:
                lca = a
            else:
                break
        return lca
```

#### Approach

The most direct way to think about a lowest common ancestor is to first find the
two paths that lead from the root down to `p` and to `q`. Once both paths are in
hand, they share a common prefix that starts at the root and runs until they
diverge; the last node before that divergence is the LCA.

1. Write a small recursive search that builds the root-to-target path by hand:
   append the current node, return success if it is the target, otherwise try
   each subtree, and `pop` the node back off when neither subtree contains the
   target.
2. Run that search twice, once for `p` and once for `q`, producing two lists of
   nodes ordered from the root downward.
3. Walk the two paths together. While the nodes match, the shared ancestor keeps
   getting deeper; the moment they differ (or one path ends), the last matching
   node is the answer.

Because a node is allowed to be a descendant of itself, a path that ends at the
other target's path naturally yields that target as the LCA: `zip` simply stops
at the shorter path.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Each path search may visit every node once in the worst case, and comparing the
two paths is bounded by the tree height. The total work is linear in the number
of nodes.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

Both path lists and the recursion stack are each bounded by the tree height,
which is `O(n)` for a skewed tree.

#### Key Insights

- Reframing "common ancestor" as "common prefix of two root-to-node paths" makes
  the problem concrete and easy to reason about without any cleverness.
- Building the path by appending on the way down and popping on the way back is
  the standard backtracking pattern for recording a route through a tree.
- It is wasteful compared with the single-pass solutions: it scans the tree twice
  and stores two full paths, but it is the most obvious approach to derive.

#### Walkthrough

Trace the first solution on Example 1: `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`,
`p = 5`, `q = 1`. That tree looks like this, with `5` and `1` being the two
children of the root `3`:

```
        3
       / \
      5   1
     / \ / \
    6  2 0  8
      / \
     7   4
```

First, `find_path` builds the route from the root down to `p = 5`. It appends
each node on the way in and `pop`s any node whose subtrees do not contain the
target:

| Call | `path` while inside | Result |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| `find_path(3, 5)` | `[3]` | recurse left |
| `find_path(5, 5)` | `[3, 5]` | `node is target`, returns `True` |

The `True` bubbles straight back up, so nothing is popped: `path_p = [3, 5]`.

Next the same search runs for `q = 1`. The root `3` is appended, its left subtree
(rooted at `5`) is searched first and fails, so that exploration unwinds and pops
itself back off, then the right subtree finds the target:

| Call | `path` while inside | Result |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| `find_path(3, 1)` | `[3]` | left subtree fails, try right |
| `find_path(1, 1)` | `[3, 1]` | `node is target`, returns `True` |

So `path_q = [3, 1]`.

Finally, walk the two paths in lockstep with `zip` and keep the last node they
share:

| Step | `a` (from `path_p`) | `b` (from `path_q`) | `a is b`? | `lca` |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | `3` | `3` | yes | `3` |
| 2 | `5` | `1` | no, `break` | `3` |

The paths agree on the root and immediately diverge, so the loop breaks with
`lca = 3`. The function returns the node `3`, which matches the expected Output
of `3`.

### Recursive DFS

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # An empty subtree contains neither target; a node that is p or q
        # reports itself upward
        if not root or root is p or root is q:
            return root

        # Search both subtrees for the targets
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        # Targets found on opposite sides -> this node is their LCA
        if left and right:
            return root

        # Otherwise both lie in (at most) one subtree; bubble up that result
        return left if left else right
```

#### Approach

The lowest common ancestor is the deepest node from which `p` and `q` are
reachable in different directions (or the node that is itself one of them while
the other lies below). A single post-order traversal answers this: each call
reports back the relevant node it found, and the first node that hears back from
*both* of its sides is the LCA.

1. Base case: a `None` subtree returns `None`. If the current node *is* `p` or
   `q`, return it immediately. Because the inputs are guaranteed present and a
   node may be its own ancestor, this correctly handles the case where one target
   sits above the other.
2. Recurse into the left and right subtrees.
3. If both recursive calls return non-null, `p` and `q` were found on opposite
   sides, so the current node is their lowest common ancestor.
4. If only one side is non-null, both targets live within that side; propagate
   that node upward unchanged.

Correctness follows from the post-order order: a node only declares itself the
LCA once both descendants have reported, guaranteeing we return the deepest such
node.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

In the worst case we visit every node once, doing constant work per node.

##### Space Complexity: `O(h)`

The recursion stack is bounded by the tree height `h`, which is `O(n)` for a
skewed tree and `O(log n)` for a balanced one.

#### Key Insights

- Returning the found target (or `None`) from each call lets the recursion both
  locate the nodes and identify the split point in one pass.
- The node where the search "splits", with one target on each side, is exactly
  the LCA.
- Identity comparison (`is`) is used because we are matching node references, not
  values.
- Allowing a node to be a descendant of itself is handled for free by returning
  early when `root is p or root is q`.

### Iterative with Parent Pointers

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # Record each node's parent by walking the tree until both targets seen.
        parent = {root: None}
        queue = deque([root])

        while p not in parent or q not in parent:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node.left:
                parent[node.left] = node
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                parent[node.right] = node
                queue.append(node.right)

        # Collect every ancestor of p (including p itself) into a set.
        ancestors = set()
        node = p
        while node:
            ancestors.add(node)
            node = parent[node]

        # Climb from q until we hit the first node shared with p's ancestry.
        node = q
        while node not in ancestors:
            node = parent[node]
        return node
```

#### Approach

Instead of recursing, this approach makes the tree's implicit upward edges
explicit by recording each node's parent during a breadth-first walk. Once both
`p` and `q` have parents on record, the LCA becomes the first shared node along
the two upward paths to the root.

1. Traverse the tree (BFS here), storing `parent[child] = node` for every node
   discovered. Stop as soon as both `p` and `q` appear in the `parent` map, since
   nothing below them matters.
2. Walk upward from `p` to the root, collecting every node on that path into an
   `ancestors` set.
3. Walk upward from `q`. The first node already present in `ancestors` is the
   lowest node common to both paths, which is exactly the LCA.

The root's parent is set to `None` so the upward walks terminate cleanly. This
mirrors the classic technique for finding the intersection of two linked paths,
applied to the chains of ancestry running from each target to the root.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Building the parent map visits at most every node once. Each upward walk is
bounded by the tree height, which is itself `O(n)`, so the total stays linear.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The `parent` map stores one entry per visited node, the BFS queue can hold up to
a full level, and the `ancestors` set holds one path to the root. All three are
bounded by `O(n)`.

#### Key Insights

- Recording parent pointers converts the downward-only tree into a structure
  where each node can climb back toward the root, which is what makes the
  iterative solution possible.
- Halting the traversal once both targets are mapped avoids scanning the entire
  tree when both nodes appear early.
- Gathering one target's ancestry into a set turns the "first common ancestor"
  question into a simple membership test as the other target climbs.
- Setting the root's parent to `None` gives both upward walks a guaranteed
  termination point.

## Comparison of Solutions

### Time Complexity

- **Find Root-to-Node Paths**: `O(n)` - Two path searches each touch every node once in the worst case.
- **Recursive DFS**: `O(n)` - A single post-order traversal touches each node once.
- **Iterative with Parent Pointers**: `O(n)` - Building the parent map is linear, and the two upward walks are each bounded by the tree height.

### Space Complexity

- **Find Root-to-Node Paths**: `O(n)` - Two path lists and the recursion stack are each bounded by the tree height.
- **Recursive DFS**: `O(h)` - Only the recursion stack is used, bounded by tree height `h`.
- **Iterative with Parent Pointers**: `O(n)` - The parent map, BFS queue, and ancestor set each scale with the node count.

### Trade-offs

- **Find Root-to-Node Paths**: The most intuitive to derive, but it scans the tree twice and stores two full paths instead of answering in a single pass.
- **Recursive DFS**: Compact and elegant with no auxiliary data structures, but it relies on the call stack, which can overflow on a deeply skewed tree of `10^5` nodes.
- **Iterative with Parent Pointers**: Avoids recursion depth limits entirely, but it allocates explicit maps and sets that consume more memory.

### When to Use Each

- **Find Root-to-Node Paths**: As a teaching baseline, or when you also need the actual paths to `p` and `q`, not just their meeting point.
- **Recursive DFS (Recommended)**: Best for interviews and balanced trees - the cleanest expression of the LCA idea in a single pass.
- **Iterative with Parent Pointers**: When the tree may be extremely deep and recursion could exceed Python's stack limit, or when an explicit non-recursive solution is required.

### Optimization Notes

- The Find Root-to-Node Paths approach collapses into the single-pass Recursive DFS once you notice the split point can be detected during the descent itself, without materializing both paths.
- The recursive solution can convert to an explicit stack if recursion depth is the only concern, but the parent-pointer approach reads more naturally.
- Stopping the BFS as soon as both targets are recorded prevents needless traversal of the rest of the tree when `p` and `q` sit near the top.
- For repeated LCA queries on a static tree, precomputing parent pointers (or binary-lifting tables) once amortizes the cost across many queries, which neither single-query solution exploits.
