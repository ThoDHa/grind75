# [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

**Easy** | **20 minutes** | **Array**

**Pattern:** [DP 1D Linear](../patterns/dp_1d_linear/intuition.md)

**Practice:** [`practice/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock/solution.py`](../../practice/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock/solution.py)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the
`i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and
choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot
achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = `1`) and sell on day 5 (price = `6`), profit = `6-1 = 5`.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2

**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`

**Output:** `0`

**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = `0`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solutions

### Brute Force

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        n = len(prices)
        for buy in range(n):
            for sell in range(buy + 1, n):
                max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[sell] - prices[buy])
        return max_profit
```

#### Approach

The most direct reading of the problem is to try every valid pair of days: buy on
day `buy`, sell on a later day `sell`, and keep the largest difference.

1. Initialize `max_profit` to `0` so that an all-losses input returns `0`.
2. For each candidate buy day `buy`, scan every later sell day `sell`.
3. Compute `prices[sell] - prices[buy]` and update `max_profit` when it is larger.
4. Return `max_profit` after every pair has been considered.

Restricting the inner loop to `sell > buy` enforces the rule that the sale must
happen strictly after the purchase, so no invalid transaction is ever counted.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`

The nested loops examine every ordered pair of days, which is about `n * (n - 1) / 2`
comparisons. With `prices.length` up to `10^5`, this quadratic work is too slow in
practice but is the natural baseline.

##### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

Only the scalar accumulator `max_profit` and the loop indices are kept, independent
of the input size.

#### Key Insights

- Exhaustively checking pairs guarantees correctness and is easy to reason about.
- The `sell > buy` bound is what encodes the buy-before-sell constraint.
- The redundant rescanning of earlier prices is exactly what the next approach removes.

#### Walkthrough

Trace the Brute Force on Example 1: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`. The outer loop fixes a
`buy` day, the inner loop tries every later `sell` day, and `max_profit` only ever
moves up. Each row shows the pair being tested, the candidate profit
`prices[sell] - prices[buy]`, and `max_profit` after the `max(...)` update.

| `buy` (price) | `sell` (price) | candidate | `max_profit` after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0` (`7`) | `1` (`1`) | `-6` | `0` |
| `0` (`7`) | `2` (`5`) | `-2` | `0` |
| `0` (`7`) | `3` (`3`) | `-4` | `0` |
| `0` (`7`) | `4` (`6`) | `-1` | `0` |
| `0` (`7`) | `5` (`4`) | `-3` | `0` |
| `1` (`1`) | `2` (`5`) | `4` | `4` |
| `1` (`1`) | `3` (`3`) | `2` | `4` |
| `1` (`1`) | `4` (`6`) | `5` | `5` |
| `1` (`1`) | `5` (`4`) | `3` | `5` |
| `2` (`5`) | `3` (`3`) | `-2` | `5` |
| `2` (`5`) | `4` (`6`) | `1` | `5` |
| `2` (`5`) | `5` (`4`) | `-1` | `5` |
| `3` (`3`) | `4` (`6`) | `3` | `5` |
| `3` (`3`) | `5` (`4`) | `1` | `5` |
| `4` (`6`) | `5` (`4`) | `-2` | `5` |

The first `buy = 0` block buys at the highest price (`7`), so every candidate is
negative and `max_profit` stays at its `0` floor. The breakthrough comes with
`buy = 1` (price `1`): pairing it with `sell = 4` (price `6`) gives `6 - 1 = 5`, the
best pair in the whole array. No later pair beats it, so the loops finish and the
method returns `max_profit = 5`, matching the expected Output of `5`.

### Running Minimum

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float("inf")
        max_profit = 0
        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            elif price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price
        return max_profit
```

#### Approach

The best sell day only ever pairs with the cheapest day seen up to that point, so a
single pass suffices if we remember the lowest price encountered so far.

1. Track `min_price`, the smallest price seen so far, starting at infinity.
2. Track `max_profit`, the best profit seen so far, starting at `0`.
3. For each `price`, if it is a new minimum, update `min_price` (a better future buy).
4. Otherwise, the profit of selling today is `price - min_price`; update `max_profit`
   when that exceeds the current best.
5. Return `max_profit` after the single pass.

Because `min_price` always holds the cheapest day at or before the current index, the
candidate profit `price - min_price` is the best achievable sale ending on that day.
This is Kadane's algorithm applied to the array of day-to-day differences.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Each price is visited once and processed with constant-time comparisons and
arithmetic, giving a single linear pass over the array.

##### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

Only the two scalars `min_price` and `max_profit` are maintained regardless of the
input size.

#### Key Insights

- The optimal sell day is paired with the minimum price seen strictly before it, so
  one running minimum captures every useful buy opportunity.
- Initializing `max_profit` to `0` makes a strictly decreasing input return `0` for
  free, matching the "no transaction" rule.
- Updating `min_price` before measuring profit naturally preserves the buy-before-sell
  ordering without any extra bookkeeping.

## Comparison of Solutions

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(n^2)` - every ordered pair of days is compared.
- **Running Minimum**: `O(n)` - a single pass tracks the best buy seen so far.

### Space Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(1)` - only an accumulator and loop indices.
- **Running Minimum**: `O(1)` - two scalar trackers.

### Trade-offs

- Brute Force is the most transparent statement of the problem but rescans earlier
  prices repeatedly, making it impractical for large inputs.
- Running Minimum trades that redundant work for one remembered value, the minimum
  price so far, collapsing the quadratic scan into a linear one with no extra memory.

### When to Use Each

- **Brute Force**: Only as a conceptual baseline or for tiny inputs where clarity
  outweighs speed.
- **Running Minimum**: The right call in practice and the expected interview answer,
  since it meets the `10^5` constraint comfortably.

### Optimization Notes

- The running-minimum pass is Kadane's algorithm over the difference array
  `prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`; recognizing this connects the problem to maximum
  subarray.
- Using `float("inf")` as the initial minimum avoids a special case for the first
  element; an equivalent alternative is to seed `min_price = prices[0]` when the
  array is known to be non-empty.
