# [Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)

**Medium** | **30 minutes** | **Graph**

**Pattern:** [Union-Find](../patterns/union_find/intuition.md)

**Algorithm:** [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) · [Disjoint-set (Union-Find)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)

**Practice:** [`practice/accounts_merge/solution.py`](../../practice/accounts_merge/solution.py)

Given a list of accounts where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
```

**Output:**

```
[["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
```

**Explanation:** The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com". The third John and Mary are different people as none of their emails are used by other accounts. We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer `[['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], ['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']]` would still be accepted.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
```

**Output:**

```
[["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= accounts.length <= 1000`
- `2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30`
- `accounts[i][0]` consists of English letters.
- `accounts[i][j]` (for `j > 0`) is a valid email.

## Deriving the Solution

Two accounts belong to the same person exactly when they share an email, and
"shares an email" chains transitively across accounts. Every solution below
computes the same thing, the groups of emails connected through shared accounts;
they differ in how directly that connectivity is computed.

1. **Start literal.** Keep fusing any two groups whose email sets intersect until
   a full pass changes nothing. Each pass compares all pairs of groups and may
   merge only one, so the loop costs `O(A^3 × K)`: see
   [Brute Force](#brute-force).
2. **Spot the waste.** The repeated sweeps exist only to propagate transitivity:
   merging one pair can create a new overlap with a group already checked. The
   quantity actually being computed is connectivity, which need not be
   rediscovered pass after pass.
3. **Make the graph explicit.** Treat every email as a node and link the emails
   of each account together; every merged person is then exactly one connected
   component, recoverable with one DFS per component in linear time: see
   [DFS Connected Components](#dfs-connected-components).
4. **Skip building the graph.** A disjoint-set forest maintains the same
   components incrementally: union each account's emails as they are read, then
   group emails by their root. Near-constant work per email and no adjacency
   structure at all: see [Union-Find](#union-find).

## Solutions

### Brute Force

#### Derivation

Two accounts belong to the same person exactly when they share an email, so the
most direct idea is to keep merging overlapping accounts until none overlap. Each
account starts as its own group, and we fuse any two groups whose email sets
intersect, repeating until a full sweep changes nothing.

1. Turn each account into a `[name, set-of-emails]` group.
2. Compare every pair of groups. When two share at least one email, absorb the
   second group's emails into the first and remove the second.
3. Because a merge can create a new overlap with a group already checked, restart
   the sweeps and keep going until a complete pass merges nothing.
4. Emit each remaining group as its name followed by the emails in sorted order.

The repeated passes are what make this correct: merging a chain like `A-B` then
`B-C` requires revisiting groups, and looping until a clean pass guarantees every
transitive link is resolved.

#### Walkthrough

Let us watch the Brute Force run on Example 1, with
`accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"], ["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"], ["Mary","mary@mail.com"], ["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]`.

First, each account becomes a `[name, set-of-emails]` group, so we start with four
groups (showing each email set sorted for readability):

| Group | Name | Emails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | `John` | `{john_newyork@mail.com, johnsmith@mail.com}` |
| `1` | `John` | `{john00@mail.com, johnsmith@mail.com}` |
| `2` | `Mary` | `{mary@mail.com}` |
| `3` | `John` | `{johnnybravo@mail.com}` |

**Pass 1.** The sweep compares pairs starting from `i = 0`:

- `groups[0] & groups[1]`: both contain `johnsmith@mail.com`, so they intersect.
  Group `1`'s emails are unioned into group `0`, and group `1` is popped.
  `merged_something` becomes `True`. Group `0` is now
  `{john00@mail.com, john_newyork@mail.com, johnsmith@mail.com}`, and what was
  group `2` slides down into index `1`.
- `groups[0] & groups[1]` (now `Mary`): no shared email, so `j` advances.
- `groups[0] & groups[2]` (now `John` / `johnnybravo@mail.com`): no shared email.
- `i` advances through the remaining `Mary` and `johnnybravo` groups; none of
  their pairs intersect.

State after Pass 1 (three groups remain):

| Group | Name | Emails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | `John` | `{john00@mail.com, john_newyork@mail.com, johnsmith@mail.com}` |
| `1` | `Mary` | `{mary@mail.com}` |
| `2` | `John` | `{johnnybravo@mail.com}` |

**Pass 2.** Because `merged_something` was `True`, we sweep again. Every pair is
now checked: no two groups share an email, so nothing merges and
`merged_something` stays `False`. The `while` loop exits.

Finally, each surviving group is emitted as its name followed by its emails sorted:

```
[["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],
 ["Mary","mary@mail.com"],
 ["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
```

This matches the expected Output for Example 1 (the accounts may appear in any
order).

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's merge-until-stable loop: nested sweeps that fuse
intersecting groups, restarted by the `merged_something` flag after any merge.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Each entry: [name, set of emails]. Start with one group per account.
        groups = [[account[0], set(account[1:])] for account in accounts]

        # Repeatedly fuse any two groups that share an email, until a full
        # pass finds nothing to merge.
        merged_something = True
        while merged_something:
            merged_something = False
            i = 0
            while i < len(groups):
                j = i + 1
                while j < len(groups):
                    # Two groups belong to the same person if their email sets
                    # intersect at all.
                    if groups[i][1] & groups[j][1]:
                        groups[i][1] |= groups[j][1]
                        groups.pop(j)
                        merged_something = True
                    else:
                        j += 1
                i += 1

        # Emit each surviving group: name followed by its emails sorted.
        return [[name] + sorted(emails) for name, emails in groups]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(A^3 × K)`

Let `A` be the number of accounts and `K` the emails per account. Each pass
compares every pair of groups (`O(A^2)`) and each comparison intersects two email
sets (`O(K)`). In the worst case a pass merges only one pair, so up to `O(A)`
passes are needed, pushing the bound to `O(A^3 × K)` before sorting. This is
far heavier than the connectivity-based solutions.

##### Space Complexity: `O(N)`

The groups collectively hold every email once, where `N` is the total number of
emails, so auxiliary storage is linear.

#### Key Insights

- The merge rule reads directly off the problem statement: overlapping email sets
  mean the same person, so fuse and repeat.
- Looping until a pass changes nothing is what handles transitive chains, where
  merging one pair exposes a new overlap elsewhere.
- Set intersection (`&`) and union (`|=`) express "share an email" and "combine
  accounts" with no graph or disjoint-set machinery.
- Correct but slow: the repeated all-pairs sweeps are the obvious cost the graph
  and union-find approaches eliminate.

### DFS Connected Components

#### Derivation

The brute force re-scans every pair of groups on every pass, and all those sweeps
accomplish is propagating transitivity. Connectivity does that for free: model
the relation directly as a graph where each email is a node and emails appearing
together in an account are connected by edges. Each connected component of that
graph is one merged person, and a [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) recovers every component
in a single traversal, with no repeated passes.

1. For each account, add edges in `graph` between the first email and every other
   email in that account. Because connectivity is transitive, linking each email
   to a single representative (the first) suffices to bind the whole account
   together, and chains across accounts merge through shared emails.
2. Record each email's account name in `owner` as it is registered.
3. Run `dfs` from every unvisited email, collecting all reachable emails into one
   `component`.
4. For each component, emit the owner's name followed by the emails sorted
   alphabetically.

Building the adjacency graph from scratch keeps the logic explicit: the merge is
nothing more than enumerating connected components, and DFS is the most direct
way to walk them.

#### Walkthrough

Let us build the graph and walk it on Example 1, writing each email by its local
part (`johnsmith` for `johnsmith@mail.com`, and so on) for brevity. Each account
links its emails to the account's first email, a star per account:

```text
account 0  first = johnsmith     johnsmith <-> john_newyork
account 1  first = johnsmith     johnsmith <-> john00
account 2  first = mary          (single email: only a self-link)
account 3  first = johnnybravo   (single email: only a self-link)
```

Single-email accounts still register themselves (the loop adds `first` to its own
adjacency set), which is what makes them appear as keys of `graph` and later be
emitted as their own components. The shared `johnsmith` node is what fuses
accounts 0 and 1: the adjacency sets end up as

```text
graph[johnsmith]    = {johnsmith, john_newyork, john00}
graph[john_newyork] = {johnsmith}
graph[john00]       = {johnsmith}
graph[mary]         = {mary}
graph[johnnybravo]  = {johnnybravo}
```

and `owner` maps every email to its account name. The result loop visits `graph`
keys in insertion order, so the first `dfs` starts at `johnsmith`. Neighbors come
from a set, whose iteration order can vary between runs; one possible order is
shown, and the collected component is the same either way:

```text
stack = [johnsmith]              pop johnsmith     visit, component = [johnsmith]
push john_newyork, john00        (johnsmith itself is already visited)
stack = [john_newyork, john00]   pop john00        visit, component = [johnsmith, john00]
stack = [john_newyork]           pop john_newyork  visit, component = [johnsmith, john00, john_newyork]
stack = []                       component complete
```

The component is emitted as `[owner[johnsmith]] + sorted(component)`, giving
`["John", "john00@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com", "johnsmith@mail.com"]`.
The keys `john_newyork` and `john00` are skipped as already visited, then `mary`
and `johnnybravo` each start a `dfs` that finds only themselves, yielding
`["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]` and `["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]`.

The three components match the expected Output for Example 1.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's two phases: the star construction per account, then
one iterative `dfs` per unvisited email.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        graph = defaultdict(set)  # email -> set of directly connected emails
        owner = {}                # email -> account name

        # Build an undirected graph: every email in an account links to the
        # account's first email, so all of them sit in one connected component.
        for account in accounts:
            name = account[0]
            first = account[1]
            for email in account[1:]:
                owner[email] = name
                graph[first].add(email)
                graph[email].add(first)

        visited = set()

        def dfs(start: str) -> list:
            # Iterative DFS collects every email reachable from start.
            stack = [start]
            component = []
            while stack:
                email = stack.pop()
                if email in visited:
                    continue
                visited.add(email)
                component.append(email)
                for neighbor in graph[email]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        stack.append(neighbor)
            return component

        result = []
        for email in graph:
            if email not in visited:
                component = dfs(email)
                # Prefix the sorted emails with the shared account name.
                result.append([owner[email]] + sorted(component))
        return result
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(N + N log K)`

Let `N` be the total number of emails and `K` the size of the largest merged
account. Each account contributes one edge per email (every email links only to
the account's first email), so the graph has `O(N)` edges in total and building
plus traversing it is `O(N)`. Sorting each component totals `O(N log K)`, which
dominates and is commonly summarized as `O(N log N)`.

##### Space Complexity: `O(N)`

The star construction adds `O(1)` edges per email, so the adjacency graph holds
`O(N)` entries in total. The `owner` map and `visited` set are `O(N)`, and the
DFS stack is bounded by the component size.

#### Key Insights

- Treating emails as graph nodes makes the merge a textbook connected-components
  problem, no special data structure required beyond a dictionary of adjacency
  sets.
- Linking every email to the account's first email (a star within each account)
  is enough to connect the account; full pairwise edges are unnecessary.
- An iterative DFS with an explicit stack sidesteps any recursion-depth concern
  on a component that could span thousands of emails.
- The owner name comes from any email in the component, since one component maps
  to exactly one person.

### Union-Find

#### Derivation

The DFS approach materializes the whole adjacency structure before any traversal
can begin, yet all the output needs is which component each email lands in.
"Shares an email" is a connectivity relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive, and that is precisely what [union-find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) maintains incrementally:
treat each email as a node, union the emails that appear together in one account
as they are read, and each connected component becomes one merged person, with no
adjacency sets and no traversal.

1. For every account, register each email in the `parent` forest (each email
   pointing to itself initially) and record its name in `owner`.
2. `union` every email in an account with the account's first email. After
   processing all accounts, emails reachable through any chain of shared accounts
   land in the same component.
3. Walk all emails and group them by their component root via `find` into
   `groups`.
4. For each group, emit the owner's name followed by the emails in sorted order.

Using the email strings themselves as union-find keys avoids a separate
index-mapping step. Any email in a component can supply the name because all
accounts in one component share the same person and therefore the same name.

#### Walkthrough

Let us grow the forest on Example 1, again abbreviating each email to its local
part. Reading the accounts in order, each email is registered with
`parent[email] = email` on first sight and then unioned with the account's first
email:

```text
account 0 (John)   parent[johnsmith] = johnsmith           register first email
                   union(johnsmith, johnsmith)             self-union, no change
                   parent[john_newyork] = john_newyork     register
                   union(john_newyork, johnsmith)          parent[john_newyork] = johnsmith
account 1 (John)   johnsmith already registered            union(johnsmith, johnsmith) no-op
                   parent[john00] = john00                 register
                   union(john00, johnsmith)                parent[john00] = johnsmith
account 2 (Mary)   parent[mary] = mary                     register, self-union
account 3 (John)   parent[johnnybravo] = johnnybravo       register, self-union
```

The shared `johnsmith` is what fuses accounts 0 and 1: both unions route through
`find(johnsmith)`, so `john_newyork` and `john00` hang under the same root. The
grouping loop then calls `find` on every registered email:

```text
find(johnsmith)    = johnsmith     groups[johnsmith]   = [johnsmith]
find(john_newyork) = johnsmith     groups[johnsmith]   = [johnsmith, john_newyork]
find(john00)       = johnsmith     groups[johnsmith]   = [johnsmith, john_newyork, john00]
find(mary)         = mary          groups[mary]        = [mary]
find(johnnybravo)  = johnnybravo   groups[johnnybravo] = [johnnybravo]
```

On this input every non-root already points directly at its root, so the path
compression line inside `find` never rewrites a pointer; on longer chains it
halves the path toward the root on every call. Emitting
`[owner[root]] + sorted(emails)` per group gives

```
[["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],
 ["Mary","mary@mail.com"],
 ["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
```

which matches the expected Output for Example 1.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's forest: registration and `union` while reading
accounts, then one `find` per email to group the components.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        parent = {}          # email -> parent email (union-find forest)
        owner = {}           # email -> account name

        def find(email: str) -> str:
            # Path compression: flatten the chain toward the root.
            while parent[email] != email:
                parent[email] = parent[parent[email]]
                email = parent[email]
            return email

        def union(a: str, b: str) -> None:
            parent[find(a)] = find(b)

        # Register every email and union all emails that share an account.
        for account in accounts:
            name = account[0]
            first = account[1]
            for email in account[1:]:
                if email not in parent:
                    parent[email] = email
                    owner[email] = name
                union(email, first)

        # Group every email under the representative root of its component.
        groups = defaultdict(list)
        for email in parent:
            groups[find(email)].append(email)

        # Build each merged account: name followed by sorted emails.
        return [[owner[root]] + sorted(emails)
                for root, emails in groups.items()]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(N × α(N) + N log K)`

Let `N` be the total number of emails across all accounts and `K` the size of
the largest merged account. The union-find operations cost `O(N × α(N))`, where
`α` is the inverse Ackermann function (effectively constant). Sorting the emails
within each group totals `O(N log K)` in the worst case, which dominates and is
commonly written simply as `O(N log N)`.

##### Space Complexity: `O(N)`

The `parent`, `owner`, and `groups` structures each hold one entry per distinct
email, so auxiliary space is linear in the number of emails.

#### Key Insights

- Modeling "shares an email" as a connectivity relation turns a fuzzy merge into
  a clean connected-components problem solvable with union-find.
- Using the email strings directly as forest keys removes the bookkeeping of
  mapping emails to integer ids.
- Unioning every email to the account's first email (rather than pairwise across
  all emails) is enough to connect the whole account, and it is simpler.
- Path compression keeps `find` near-constant, so even 1000 accounts with up to
  10 emails each resolve quickly.
- The owner name can be pulled from any email in a component, since a merged
  component always corresponds to a single person with one name.

## Comparison of Solutions

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(A^3 × K)` - Up to `O(A)` passes, each comparing all `O(A^2)` group pairs with an `O(K)` set intersection.
- **DFS Connected Components**: `O(N + N log K)` - The star construction keeps total edges at `O(N)`, so building and traversing the graph is linear; per-component sorting dominates.
- **Union-Find**: `O(N × α(N) + N log K)` - Near-constant union/find operations per email, then per-component sorting; the inverse-Ackermann factor makes connectivity effectively faster than explicit traversal.

### Space Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(N)` - The groups collectively hold each email once.
- **DFS Connected Components**: `O(N)` - The star construction adds `O(1)` edges per email, so the adjacency graph, owner map, and visited set are all linear.
- **Union-Find**: `O(N)` - Only flat parent and owner maps, one entry per email.

### Trade-offs

- **Brute Force**: Mirrors the problem statement directly (overlapping email sets merge), but the repeated all-pairs sweeps make it the slowest by far.
- **DFS Connected Components**: Builds the graph explicitly, which makes the connected-components structure obvious, but the adjacency sets cost more memory than a flat parent array.
- **Union-Find**: More compact in memory and asymptotically faster on the connectivity step, at the cost of the less-intuitive disjoint-set machinery.

### When to Use Each

- **Brute Force**: As a teaching baseline or for tiny inputs, where the merge-until-stable idea is easiest to reason about.
- **DFS Connected Components**: When clarity matters or when an explicit graph is already available, since the merge reads as a plain component walk.
- **Union-Find (Recommended)**: Best for interviews and large inputs - it is the most space-efficient and the standard answer for dynamic-connectivity merges.

### Optimization Notes

- The brute force re-scans every group pair on each pass; the graph and union-find approaches eliminate the quadratic re-checking by modeling connectivity once.
- The DFS approach trades extra adjacency-set memory for conceptual simplicity; switching the recursion to an explicit stack (as shown) keeps it safe on huge components.
- Union-find with path compression keeps the connectivity step near-linear, so for the largest inputs it edges out the explicit graph traversal.
- Both approaches are dominated by the per-component sort in practice, so neither can drop below `O(N log K)` while emails must be returned in sorted order.
- Linking each account's emails to a single representative (rather than all pairs) keeps edge count low in both solutions.
- A common alternative unions *account indices* instead of email strings: map each email to the first account that mentioned it, and union the current account with that one on any repeat sighting. The forest then holds only `A` account nodes instead of `N` email nodes, and the merged name falls out of the account index directly, at the cost of one extra email-to-account map.
