## Examples

### Example 1

![Binary Tree Example](assets/binary_tree_level_order_traversal_example1.jpg)

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`

**Output:** `[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]`

### Example 2

**Input:** `root = [1]`

**Output:** `[[1]]`

### Example 3

**Input:** `root = []`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solutions

### Brute Force

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Walk the whole tree, recording each value alongside its depth
        pairs = []

        def visit(node: Optional[TreeNode], depth: int) -> None:
            if not node:
                return
            pairs.append((depth, node.val))
            visit(node.left, depth + 1)
            visit(node.right, depth + 1)

        visit(root, 0)
        if not pairs:
            return []

        # Group the collected values by depth into per-level buckets
        max_depth = 0
        for depth, _ in pairs:
            if depth > max_depth:
                max_depth = depth
        result = [[] for _ in range(max_depth + 1)]
        for depth, val in pairs:
            result[depth].append(val)
        return result
```

#### Approach

The most direct idea ignores any clever level-grouping trick: just walk the entire tree, remember the depth of every node as you pass it, then sort the values into level buckets afterward. Because we visit the left child before the right child, the values within each depth already arrive in left-to-right order.

1. Traverse the tree, appending a `(depth, value)` pair for every node, starting the root at depth `0`.
2. Return an empty list immediately if no pairs were collected (the tree was empty).
3. Scan the pairs once to find the maximum depth, which is the number of levels minus one.
4. Allocate one empty bucket per level, then drop each value into `result[depth]`.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

The traversal touches each of the `n` nodes once, and the two follow-up scans over the collected pairs are each linear, so the total work is `O(n)`.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The intermediate `pairs` list holds one entry per node, the output holds all `n` values, and the recursion stack adds `O(h)` for height `h`, so the auxiliary space is `O(n)`.

#### Key Insights

- Separating collection from grouping makes the logic obvious at the cost of a full intermediate `pairs` list.
- Visiting left before right is what keeps each level's values in the correct order without any extra sorting.
- It does redundant work: it stores every node's depth explicitly and walks the pairs twice, where the refined approaches group on the fly.

### Recursive DFS

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []

        def visit(node: Optional[TreeNode], depth: int) -> None:
            if not node:
                return
            # First time we reach this depth, start a fresh sublist for it
            if depth == len(result):
                result.append([])
            result[depth].append(node.val)
            visit(node.left, depth + 1)
            visit(node.right, depth + 1)

        visit(root, 0)
        return result
```

#### Approach

A depth-first traversal can produce level-order output if it tracks how deep each node sits and appends values into the correct per-level bucket:

1. Maintain a `result` list whose index `depth` holds the values for that level.
2. Recurse with a `depth` parameter, starting at `0` for the root.
3. When `depth == len(result)`, this is the first node encountered at that depth, so append a new empty sublist to grow `result`.
4. Append the current node's value to `result[depth]`.
5. Recurse into the left child before the right child, both at `depth + 1`.

Visiting left before right in preorder guarantees that values land in each level's sublist in left-to-right order, matching the BFS output exactly even though the traversal itself is depth-first.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Each node is visited once and performs constant work, so the traversal is linear in the number of nodes.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The output stores all `n` values. The recursion stack adds `O(h)` for the tree height `h`, which is `O(n)` for a skewed tree and `O(log n)` when balanced, so the output term dominates at `O(n)`.

#### Key Insights

- Indexing `result` by depth turns DFS into a level grouping without any queue.
- The `depth == len(result)` check is the lazy-allocation trick that creates each level's bucket exactly when first needed.
- Preorder left-before-right is what keeps every level ordered correctly.
- This approach is convenient when recursion is already natural for the surrounding code, trading queue space for recursion-stack space.

### Iterative BFS

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []

        result = []
        queue = deque([root])
        while queue:
            level_size = len(queue)
            level = []
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            result.append(level)
        return result
```

#### Approach

Level order traversal is a textbook breadth-first search. The trick that separates it from the brute force is grouping nodes by level on the fly, which we achieve by measuring each level's size before draining it:

1. Return an empty list immediately when the tree is empty.
2. Seed a queue with `root`.
3. While the queue is non-empty, capture `level_size = len(queue)`: the exact count of nodes on the current level.
4. Dequeue that many nodes, collecting their values into a fresh `level` list and enqueuing each node's children (left then right).
5. Append the completed `level` to `result` and repeat for the next level.

Snapshotting `level_size` at the top of each iteration is what cleanly partitions the output into per-level sublists, since any children appended during the loop belong to the next level and are excluded from the current count.

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Every node is enqueued and dequeued exactly once, and each contributes constant work, giving linear time in the number of nodes.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The output stores all `n` node values. The queue independently holds at most one level, which is up to `n/2` nodes for a complete tree, so the auxiliary space is also `O(n)`.

#### Key Insights

- Recording `level_size` before the inner loop is the idiomatic way to separate BFS levels without sentinel markers.
- A `deque` gives `O(1)` `popleft`, unlike a plain list whose `pop(0)` is `O(n)`.
- Enqueuing left before right preserves the required left-to-right ordering within each level.
- Unlike the brute force, no intermediate `(depth, value)` list is needed: the queue groups levels directly, and the pattern generalizes to zigzag traversal, right side view, and per-level aggregates.

## Comparison of Solutions

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(n)` - One traversal plus two linear scans over the collected pairs
- **Recursive DFS**: `O(n)` - Each node is visited once
- **Iterative BFS**: `O(n)` - Each node is enqueued and dequeued once

### Space Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(n)` - Output plus a full intermediate `(depth, value)` list and an `O(h)` recursion stack
- **Recursive DFS**: `O(n)` - Output plus an `O(h)` recursion stack
- **Iterative BFS**: `O(n)` - Output plus a queue holding up to one full level

### Trade-offs

- Brute Force separates collection from grouping for maximum clarity, but pays for an intermediate pairs list and a second pass that the on-the-fly approaches avoid.
- Recursive DFS removes the explicit queue and groups levels during the walk by indexing `result` by depth, but introduces a recursion stack that can overflow on a very deep tree.
- Iterative BFS maps directly to the level-by-level framing, making the level grouping obvious from the queue mechanics, and avoids deep recursion entirely.
- BFS peaks at the widest level, while DFS peaks at the tallest path, so the cheaper auxiliary structure depends on tree shape.

### When to Use Each

- **Brute Force**: As a teaching baseline when separating the traversal from the grouping makes the logic clearest.
- **Recursive DFS**: When recursion is already idiomatic in the surrounding code and the tree depth is bounded.
- **Iterative BFS**: The recommended default; when the level-by-level reading is the clearest expression of the problem, or when the tree may be very deep.

### Optimization Notes

- All three approaches are `O(n)` time, so the choice is driven by which auxiliary structure better fits the expected tree shape.
- Both refinements drop the brute force's intermediate `(depth, value)` list by grouping levels as they go.
- For very deep trees, BFS avoids the recursion-depth ceiling that both recursive solutions can hit.
- Indexing the result list by depth lets DFS group levels without sentinel markers, mirroring how BFS uses `level_size`.
