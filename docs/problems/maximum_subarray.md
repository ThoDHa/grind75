**Algorithm:** [Kadane's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) · [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) · [Divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) · [Prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum)

**Practice:** [`practice/maximum_subarray/solution.py`](../../practice/maximum_subarray/solution.py)

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return *its sum*.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`

**Output:** `6`

**Explanation:** The subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum 6.

### Example 2

**Input:** `nums = [1]`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:** The subarray `[1]` has the largest sum 1.

### Example 3

**Input:** `nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]`

**Output:** `23`

**Explanation:** The subarray `[5,4,-1,7,8]` has the largest sum 23.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Follow-up

If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the **divide and conquer approach**, which is more subtle.

## Deriving the Solution

A subarray is fixed by its two endpoints, so the literal search enumerates pairs
of endpoints and is quadratic. Every faster solution replaces one endpoint with a
quantity that can be carried through a single left-to-right scan.

1. **Start literal.** Enumerate every `(start, end)` pair, carrying a running sum
   so each extension costs constant work. Correct but `O(n^2)`: see
   [Brute Force](#brute-force).
2. **Spot the waste.** The best subarray ending at index `i` either extends the
   best one ending at `i - 1` or starts fresh at `nums[i]`; the brute force
   relearns that fact from scratch for every start index.
3. **Carry it.** Keep just two quantities per step, the best sum ending here and
   the best sum seen anywhere, and the scan becomes `O(n)`. Held as two scalars
   this is [Kadane's Algorithm](#kadanes-algorithm); held as an explicit array it
   is [Dynamic Programming with Explicit Table](#dynamic-programming-with-explicit-table).
4. **Reformulate with prefixes.** The sum of `nums[i..j]` is a difference of two
   prefix sums, so maximizing a subarray ending at `j` means subtracting the
   smallest earlier prefix: the same `O(n)` through a different lens: see
   [Prefix-Sum Minimum](#prefix-sum-minimum).
5. **Answer the follow-up.** Splitting the array in half forces the best subarray
   to lie entirely left, entirely right, or across the middle, giving an
   `O(n log n)` recursion: see [Divide and Conquer](#divide-and-conquer).
6. **Lean on the library.** Kadane's recurrence is a scan, and
   `itertools.accumulate` is the standard library's scan primitive: see
   [Library One-Liner with `itertools.accumulate`](#library-one-liner-with-itertoolsaccumulate).

## Solutions

### Brute Force

#### Derivation

The most direct idea is to consider every possible contiguous subarray, sum it,
and keep the largest sum found. A subarray is fixed by its start and end indices,
so two nested loops enumerate all of them.

1. Initialize `best` to `nums[0]` so the answer is valid even when every number is negative.
2. For each start index, reset a `current` running sum to `0`.
3. Sweep `end` from `start` to the array's end, adding `nums[end]` to `current` so it always holds the sum of `nums[start..end]`.
4. Update `best` with the largest sum seen at any `(start, end)` pair.
5. Return `best` after all pairs are examined.

Carrying the running sum across the inner loop avoids re-adding the same prefix
for every end, which keeps the work quadratic rather than cubic.

#### Walkthrough

Example 1 has 9 elements, which makes 45 `(start, end)` pairs: too many to trace by hand. So this walkthrough uses a smaller array, `nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4]`, whose largest subarray is `[4]` with sum `4`.

We start with `best = nums[0] = -2`. The outer loop fixes each `start`; for each one we reset `current = 0`, then sweep `end` from `start` to the array's end, adding `nums[end]` to `current` (so `current` always holds the sum of `nums[start..end]`) and updating `best` with `max(best, current)`.

Each row below is one `(start, end)` pair: the element just added, the running `current` sum, and `best` after the update.

| `start` | `end` | `nums[end]` | `current` (sum of `nums[start..end]`) | `best` |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 0 | 0 | `-2` | `-2` | `-2` |
| 0 | 1 | `1` | `-1` | `-1` |
| 0 | 2 | `-3` | `-4` | `-1` |
| 0 | 3 | `4` | `0` | `0` |
| 1 | 1 | `1` | `1` | `1` |
| 1 | 2 | `-3` | `-2` | `1` |
| 1 | 3 | `4` | `2` | `2` |
| 2 | 2 | `-3` | `-3` | `2` |
| 2 | 3 | `4` | `1` | `2` |
| 3 | 3 | `4` | `4` | `4` |

When `start` moves to a new index, `current` resets to `0` before the first `end` is added, so each row's `current` is the sum of exactly the subarray `nums[start..end]`. The largest `current` ever seen is `4`, from the single-element subarray `[4]` at `start = end = 3`.

After all pairs are examined, the loop returns `best = 4`, which matches the expected sum of the best subarray for `[-2, 1, -3, 4]`.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's double loop: fix `start`, grow `end`, carry
`current`.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        best = nums[0]

        for start in range(n):
            # Grow the subarray that begins at `start` one element at a time,
            # carrying the running sum so each new end is constant work.
            current = 0
            for end in range(start, n):
                current += nums[end]
                best = max(best, current)

        return best
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`

The outer loop fixes each of the `n` start indices, and the inner loop extends to the end of the array, so the total number of `(start, end)` pairs is on the order of `n^2`, each handled in constant time.

##### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

Only the `best` and `current` scalars are tracked, regardless of input size.

#### Key Insights

- Enumerates the entire search space directly, making correctness obvious without any clever observation.
- Reusing the running `current` sum is the one optimization that drops a naive `O(n^3)` re-sum down to `O(n^2)`.
- Seeding `best` with `nums[0]` rather than `0` is what handles the all-negative case correctly.
- Too slow for the upper constraint of `10^5` elements, which motivates the linear approaches below.

### Kadane's Algorithm

#### Derivation

The brute force spends its time relearning: the sums it accumulates for one start
index tell it nothing about the next, so every start pays for a fresh sweep. The
repair comes from asking a narrower question: what is the largest sum of a
subarray that ends exactly at index `i`? That single quantity is cheap to carry
forward, and the overall answer is its maximum over every `i`.
[Kadane's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)
scans the array once while tracking two quantities: `current_sum`, the largest
sum of any subarray that ends at the current index, and `max_sum`, the largest
sum seen anywhere so far.

1. Initialize both `current_sum` and `max_sum` to `nums[0]`, since the answer must contain at least one element.
2. For each subsequent element, decide whether to extend the running subarray or begin a new one at the current element: `current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])`.
3. Update `max_sum` with the best `current_sum` observed.
4. Return `max_sum` after the single pass.

The decision at step 2 is correct because a subarray ending at index `i` either stands alone (`nums[i]`) or extends the best subarray ending at `i - 1`. Any negative prefix can only hurt, so the algorithm discards it by restarting.

#### Recurrence

Let \(\text{end}[i]\) be the largest sum of any subarray that *ends* at index
`i`. Such a subarray either starts at `i` or extends the best one ending at
`i-1`:

$$
\text{end}[i] =
\begin{cases}
\text{nums}[0], & i = 0 \\[4pt]
\max\bigl(\text{nums}[i],\ \text{end}[i-1] + \text{nums}[i]\bigr), & i \ge 1
\end{cases}
$$

```text
end[0] = nums[0]
end[i] = max(nums[i], end[i - 1] + nums[i])   for i >= 1
```

The answer maximizes over every possible endpoint:

$$
\text{answer} = \max_{0 \le i < n} \text{end}[i]
$$

```text
answer = max(end[i]) over 0 <= i < n
```

Anchoring the state to "ends at `i`" is what makes the problem one-dimensional.
The obvious state ("best subarray within the first `i` elements") cannot be
extended, because it does not record whether the winning subarray touches the
right edge. `current_sum` carries \(\text{end}[i]\) and `max_sum` carries the
running outer maximum, so Kadane's is this pair of formulas with the array
collapsed to two scalars.

#### Walkthrough

Let us run the scan by hand on Example 1: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`. Both
`current_sum` and `max_sum` start at `nums[0] = -2`. At each later index the
decision `max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])` either extends the running
subarray or restarts it at `nums[i]`:

```text
i=0  nums[0]=-2   current_sum = -2               max_sum = -2   both seeded
i=1  nums[1]= 1   max( 1, -2+1) =  1   restart   max_sum =  1
i=2  nums[2]=-3   max(-3,  1-3) = -2   extend    max_sum =  1
i=3  nums[3]= 4   max( 4, -2+4) =  4   restart   max_sum =  4
i=4  nums[4]=-1   max(-1,  4-1) =  3   extend    max_sum =  4
i=5  nums[5]= 2   max( 2,  3+2) =  5   extend    max_sum =  5
i=6  nums[6]= 1   max( 1,  5+1) =  6   extend    max_sum =  6
i=7  nums[7]=-5   max(-5,  6-5) =  1   extend    max_sum =  6
i=8  nums[8]= 4   max( 4,  1+4) =  5   extend    max_sum =  6
```

The two restarts happen exactly where the carried sum has turned negative: at
`i=1` the prefix `-2` would only hurt, and at `i=3` the carried `-2` is dropped
in favor of starting at `4`. From there the run `4, -1, 2, 1` lifts
`current_sum` to `6`, which `max_sum` records and later dips never erase.

The scan returns `max_sum = 6`, the sum of `[4,-1,2,1]`, matching the expected
Output for Example 1.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's two columns kept as scalars: `current_sum` and
`max_sum` updated once per element.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        current_sum = nums[0]
        max_sum = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            # Extend the previous subarray, or start fresh at nums[i].
            # Starting fresh wins exactly when current_sum is negative.
            current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

        return max_sum
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

The array is traversed exactly once, performing constant work per element.

##### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

Only two scalar accumulators are maintained regardless of input size.

#### Key Insights

- A subarray ending at `i` is fully described by a single running sum, collapsing the search space to one scan.
- Restarting whenever `current_sum` turns negative is the heart of the algorithm.
- Initializing with `nums[0]` (rather than `0`) handles the all-negative case correctly, returning the least-negative element.

### Dynamic Programming with Explicit Table

#### Derivation

Kadane's two scalars can feel like a trick until the recurrence behind them is
written out in full. This formulation asks the same question, the best sum of a
subarray ending at each index, but stores every intermediate answer in an array,
making the [dynamic-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
structure explicit.

1. Define `dp[i]` as the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at index `i`.
2. Set the base case `dp[0] = nums[0]`.
3. Apply the recurrence `dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i - 1] + nums[i])` left to right.
4. The answer is `max(dp)`, since the best subarray must end at some index.

#### Walkthrough

Let us fill the table by hand on Example 1: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`.
Each `dp[i]` is computed from `dp[i - 1]` by the recurrence:

```text
i=0  dp[0] = nums[0]      = -2
i=1  dp[1] = max( 1, -2+1) =  1
i=2  dp[2] = max(-3,  1-3) = -2
i=3  dp[3] = max( 4, -2+4) =  4
i=4  dp[4] = max(-1,  4-1) =  3
i=5  dp[5] = max( 2,  3+2) =  5
i=6  dp[6] = max( 1,  5+1) =  6
i=7  dp[7] = max(-5,  6-5) =  1
i=8  dp[8] = max( 4,  1+4) =  5
```

The finished table is `dp = [-2, 1, -2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 5]`: entry by entry the
same values `current_sum` took in the Kadane walkthrough, now all retained. The
final answer is `max(dp) = 6`, at `dp[6]`, where the subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` ends,
matching the expected Output for Example 1.

#### Solution

The code fills the walkthrough's `dp` array left to right, then takes its
maximum.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        # dp[i] = largest sum of a subarray ending exactly at index i.
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i - 1] + nums[i])

        return max(dp)
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Filling the table takes one pass, and the final `max(dp)` takes one more linear pass.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The explicit `dp` array stores one value per element.

#### Key Insights

- Makes the recurrence visible, which is useful when learning the pattern or when the per-index states are needed later.
- Kadane's algorithm is simply this recurrence with the table compressed to a single rolling variable.
- The base case `dp[0] = nums[0]` again guards the all-negative case.

### Divide and Conquer

#### Derivation

The follow-up asks for a different route entirely:
[divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm).
Split the array at its midpoint and ask where the best subarray can live. There
are only three possibilities: entirely in the left half, entirely in the right
half, or crossing the midpoint. The two halves are the same problem on smaller
inputs, so recursion handles them; only the crossing case needs new work.

1. Base case: a single element returns its own value.
2. Split at `mid` and recursively solve the left and right halves with `divide`.
3. Compute the best subarray that crosses `mid` with `max_crossing_sum`, which
   expands outward from the midpoint in both directions and adds the best left
   reach (`left_sum`) to the best right reach (`right_sum`).
4. Return the maximum of `left_max`, `right_max`, and `cross_max`.

The crossing computation is the key piece: the best crossing subarray is forced to include `nums[mid]` and `nums[mid + 1]`, so each side is found greedily by accumulating from the midpoint outward.

#### Walkthrough

Example 1's nine elements spawn a recursion tree too large to trace by hand, so
this walkthrough uses a smaller tailored array that still exercises every case:
`nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4]`, whose best subarray is `[4]` with sum `4`. Indentation
below follows the recursion; each `divide(left, right)` splits at `mid` and
combines three candidates:

```text
divide(0, 3)  mid = 1
  divide(0, 1)  mid = 0
    divide(0, 0) -> nums[0] = -2                        single element
    divide(1, 1) -> nums[1] =  1                        single element
    max_crossing_sum(0, 0, 1):
      leftward from mid=0:    current = -2   left_sum  = -2
      rightward from mid+1=1: current =  1   right_sum =  1
      cross_max = -2 + 1 = -1
    -> max(-2, 1, -1) = 1
  divide(2, 3)  mid = 2
    divide(2, 2) -> nums[2] = -3                        single element
    divide(3, 3) -> nums[3] =  4                        single element
    max_crossing_sum(2, 2, 3):
      leftward from mid=2:    current = -3   left_sum  = -3
      rightward from mid+1=3: current =  4   right_sum =  4
      cross_max = -3 + 4 = 1
    -> max(-3, 4, 1) = 4
  max_crossing_sum(0, 1, 3):
    leftward from mid=1:    sums 1, then 1+(-2) = -1    left_sum  = 1
    rightward from mid+1=2: sums -3, then -3+4  =  1    right_sum = 1
    cross_max = 1 + 1 = 2
  -> max(1, 4, 2) = 4
```

Each crossing scan is forced through the midpoint: it accumulates leftward from
`mid` keeping the best prefix, accumulates rightward from `mid + 1` keeping the
best suffix, and adds the two. The winning candidate at the top level is
`right_max = 4`, from the single-element subarray `[4]`, so `divide(0, 3)`
returns `4`, the expected answer for `[-2, 1, -3, 4]`.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's recursion: `divide` splits at `mid`, and
`max_crossing_sum` expands outward from the midpoint.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def max_crossing_sum(left: int, mid: int, right: int) -> int:
            left_sum = float("-inf")
            current = 0
            for i in range(mid, left - 1, -1):
                current += nums[i]
                left_sum = max(left_sum, current)

            right_sum = float("-inf")
            current = 0
            for i in range(mid + 1, right + 1):
                current += nums[i]
                right_sum = max(right_sum, current)

            return left_sum + right_sum

        def divide(left: int, right: int) -> int:
            if left == right:
                return nums[left]

            mid = (left + right) // 2
            left_max = divide(left, mid)
            right_max = divide(mid + 1, right)
            cross_max = max_crossing_sum(left, mid, right)

            return max(left_max, right_max, cross_max)

        return divide(0, len(nums) - 1)
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`

The recurrence is `T(n) = 2T(n / 2) + O(n)`, where the `O(n)` crossing scan at each level yields `O(log n)` levels of linear work.

##### Space Complexity: `O(log n)`

The recursion stack reaches a depth proportional to the height of the balanced split.

#### Key Insights

- The three-case decomposition (left, right, crossing) is a reusable divide-and-conquer template.
- Only the crossing case requires explicit work; the halves are handled by recursion.
- It is asymptotically slower than Kadane's, but it illustrates the paradigm and parallelizes naturally across the independent halves.

### Prefix-Sum Minimum

#### Derivation

A different reformulation reaches linear time without Kadane's restart insight.
The sum of the subarray `nums[i..j]` equals `prefix[j] - prefix[i - 1]`, a
difference of two [prefix sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum). To
maximize that difference while ending at index `j`, subtract the smallest prefix
sum seen before `j`.

1. Maintain a running `prefix` sum and `min_prefix`, the smallest prefix sum seen at any earlier boundary.
2. At each element, the best subarray ending here is `prefix - min_prefix`; update `best` with it.
3. Update `min_prefix` after using it, so the boundary is always strictly before the current end.
4. Return `best`.

Seeding `min_prefix = 0` represents the empty prefix before the array starts, which lets the subarray begin at index `0`.

#### Walkthrough

Let us run the pass by hand on Example 1: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`,
starting from `prefix = 0`, `min_prefix = 0`, `best = -inf`. Each line adds one
element to `prefix`, measures the gap back to `min_prefix`, and only then lets
`min_prefix` absorb the new `prefix`:

```text
x=-2  prefix=-2   best = max(-inf, -2-0)   = -2    min_prefix: 0 -> -2
x= 1  prefix=-1   best = max(-2, -1-(-2))  =  1    min_prefix stays -2
x=-3  prefix=-4   best stays 1  (-4-(-2) = -2)     min_prefix: -2 -> -4
x= 4  prefix= 0   best = max(1,  0-(-4))   =  4    min_prefix stays -4
x=-1  prefix=-1   best stays 4  (-1-(-4) =  3)
x= 2  prefix= 1   best = max(4,  1-(-4))   =  5
x= 1  prefix= 2   best = max(5,  2-(-4))   =  6
x=-5  prefix=-3   best stays 6  (-3-(-4) =  1)
x= 4  prefix= 1   best stays 6  ( 1-(-4) =  5)
```

After the third element `min_prefix` settles at `-4`, the prefix sum just before
index `3`, and never falls further. The best gap is reached at the seventh
element: `prefix = 2` minus `min_prefix = -4` gives `6`, which is exactly the sum
of `nums[3..6] = [4,-1,2,1]`, the subarray between those two prefix boundaries.

The pass returns `best = 6`, matching the expected Output for Example 1.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's single pass: update `prefix`, take the gap, then
lower `min_prefix`.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        best = float("-inf")
        prefix = 0
        min_prefix = 0  # smallest prefix sum strictly before the current index

        for x in nums:
            prefix += x
            best = max(best, prefix - min_prefix)
            min_prefix = min(min_prefix, prefix)

        return best
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

A single pass updates the prefix sum and running minimum.

##### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

Only three scalars are tracked.

#### Key Insights

- Recasts the problem as "largest gap between a prefix sum and an earlier minimum prefix sum."
- Equivalent in cost to Kadane's, but the prefix-sum framing generalizes to range-sum variants.
- Updating `min_prefix` after computing `best` enforces the at-least-one-element rule.

### Library One-Liner with `itertools.accumulate`

#### Derivation

Once Kadane's recurrence is in hand, the remaining code is a left-to-right scan,
and Python already ships one.
[`itertools.accumulate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
carries Kadane's recurrence as its binary combiner, producing the stream of
best-sums-ending-here, and `max` selects the overall best.

1. The accumulator starts at `nums[0]` (the first element passes through unchanged).
2. Each step applies `max(x, acc + x)`, exactly the Kadane decision to extend or restart.
3. `max(...)` over the resulting iterable is the answer.

#### Walkthrough

Here the technique being traced is the `accumulate` scan itself: what stream of
values the combiner emits on Example 1, `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`. The
accumulator `acc` starts at the first element, and every later element `x`
yields `max(x, acc + x)`:

```text
acc = -2                    first element passes through
max( 1, -2+1) -> acc =  1
max(-3,  1-3) -> acc = -2
max( 4, -2+4) -> acc =  4
max(-1,  4-1) -> acc =  3
max( 2,  3+2) -> acc =  5
max( 1,  5+1) -> acc =  6
max(-5,  6-5) -> acc =  1
max( 4,  1+4) -> acc =  5
```

The emitted stream is `[-2, 1, -2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 5]`: the same values
`current_sum` took in the Kadane walkthrough and `dp` held in the table
walkthrough. The outer `max` consumes the stream and returns `6`, matching the
expected Output for Example 1.

#### Solution

The code hands the walkthrough's combiner to `itertools.accumulate` and takes
the maximum of the stream.

```python
import itertools
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return max(itertools.accumulate(nums, lambda acc, x: max(x, acc + x)))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

`accumulate` yields `n` values, each from a constant-time combiner, and `max` consumes them once.

##### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

`accumulate` is lazy and `max` consumes it as a stream, so no intermediate list is materialized.

#### Key Insights

- A faithful compression of Kadane's algorithm into the standard library's scan primitive.
- Reads concisely, but hides the running-sum logic inside the lambda, which can obscure the core idea.
- Functionally identical in complexity to the hand-written Kadane scan.

## Comparison of Solutions

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(n^2)` - every `(start, end)` pair with a carried running sum.
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: `O(n)` - single linear scan.
- **Dynamic Programming with Explicit Table**: `O(n)` - one pass to fill the table plus one to take the max.
- **Divide and Conquer**: `O(n log n)` - `O(n)` crossing work across `O(log n)` levels.
- **Prefix-Sum Minimum**: `O(n)` - single pass tracking a running minimum prefix.
- **Library One-Liner**: `O(n)` - one accumulate-and-max pass.

### Space Complexity

- **Brute Force**: `O(1)` - two scalars for the running sum and best.
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: `O(1)` - two rolling accumulators.
- **Dynamic Programming with Explicit Table**: `O(n)` - stores one state per element.
- **Divide and Conquer**: `O(log n)` - recursion stack depth.
- **Prefix-Sum Minimum**: `O(1)` - three scalars.
- **Library One-Liner**: `O(1)` - lazy streaming with no intermediate list.

### Trade-offs

- Brute Force gains the simplest, most obviously correct enumeration but is too slow for large inputs.
- Kadane's algorithm gives the best time and space at the cost of a non-obvious restart insight.
- The explicit DP table trades `O(n)` space for clarity and reusable per-index states.
- Divide and conquer trades efficiency for a teachable paradigm and natural parallelism.
- The prefix-sum framing trades nothing in cost while opening the door to range-sum generalizations.
- The library one-liner trades readability of the core logic for brevity.

### When to Use Each

- **Brute Force**: Only as a correctness baseline or for tiny inputs; never for the full constraint.
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: The default choice for interviews and production (recommended).
- **Dynamic Programming with Explicit Table**: When teaching the recurrence or when the intermediate states are needed downstream.
- **Divide and Conquer**: When the follow-up demands it or when parallelizing across halves.
- **Prefix-Sum Minimum**: When the surrounding problem already reasons about prefix sums.
- **Library One-Liner**: When concise, idiomatic Python is preferred and the team knows Kadane's recurrence.

### Optimization Notes

- The brute force already carries a running sum to avoid re-adding prefixes, which is what keeps it `O(n^2)` instead of `O(n^3)`; the linear approaches collapse it further by reusing the best subarray ending at the previous index.
- Kadane's algorithm and the explicit DP table are the same recurrence; the former simply compresses the table to one rolling variable.
- Initializing accumulators to `nums[0]` (rather than `0`) is what makes the all-negative case correct across the linear-scan variants.
- The divide-and-conquer halves are independent and could be evaluated in parallel for very large arrays.
- All approaches handle all-negative inputs correctly, returning the maximum single element.
