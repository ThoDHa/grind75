**Algorithm:** [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) · [Tree traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal)

**Practice:** [`practice/evaluate_reverse_polish_notation/solution.py`](../../practice/evaluate_reverse_polish_notation/solution.py)

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

**Note:**

- Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in RPN.
- The answer and all intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`

**Output:** `9`

**Explanation:** ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

### Example 2

**Input:** `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`

**Output:** `6`

**Explanation:** (4 + (13 / 5)) = 4 + 2 = 6

### Example 3

**Input:** `tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`

**Output:** `22`

**Explanation:**
  ((10 *(6 / ((9 + 3)* -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 *(6 / (12* -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 *(6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10* 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

## Constraints

- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

## Deriving the Solution

An RPN expression lists each operator immediately after its two operands: it is
the post-order flattening of an expression tree, with no parentheses and no
precedence rules. Every solution below evaluates that structure in a single
linear pass; they differ only in the direction of the scan and in where the
pending operands wait.

1. **Read the structure literally.** In post-order the last token is the root
   operator, preceded by its right subtree and then its left subtree. Scanning
   right to left and recursing rebuilds and evaluates the tree directly, with
   the call stack holding the pending operands: see
   [Recursive Evaluation](#recursive-evaluation). The cost is recursion depth
   up to `O(n)`, which brushes against Python's recursion limit at the `10^4`
   token constraint.
2. **Turn the call stack into a real one.** Scan left to right instead and hold
   the operands yourself: push each number onto an explicit stack, and let each
   operator pop its two operands, combine them, and push the result. Same
   linear work, no recursion: see [Stack](#stack).
3. **Tidy the dispatch.** The four-way `if`/`elif` chain over the operators is
   data, not logic: a dictionary mapping each symbol to its function makes the
   loop body uniform and easy to extend: see
   [Operator Dispatch Table](#operator-dispatch-table).

## Solutions

### Recursive Evaluation

#### Derivation

The first question is what the token order actually encodes. An RPN expression
is the [post-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal) of
an expression tree: each operator appears immediately after the two operands it
combines. Read from the back, that means the final token is always the root
operator, and the tokens before it split into the right operand's subtree
followed by the left operand's subtree. Scanning the tokens from right to left
therefore reconstructs and evaluates the tree directly, with no stack at all:

1. Set `pos` to the last token and define a recursive `evaluate` that consumes
   tokens from the right.
2. Read the token at `pos`, then move `pos` one step left.
3. If the token is a number, convert it with `int(token)` and return it.
4. If the token is an operator, recursively evaluate the `right` operand first
   (it sits immediately to the left), then the `left` operand.
5. Combine `left` and `right` with the operator and return the result, using
   `int(left / right)` so division truncates toward zero.

The right-before-left recursion order is the crux: because we walk leftward, the
operand nearest the operator is its right child, exactly mirroring how the tree
was flattened into post-order.

#### Walkthrough

Let us watch the Recursive Evaluation run on Example 1:
`tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`, with indices `0..4`. The scan starts at
`pos = 4` (the last token) and `evaluate` always reads `tokens[pos]`, then moves
`pos` one step left. For an operator it recurses into `right` first, then `left`.

The call tree below shows each `evaluate` call, the token it reads, and what it
returns. Indentation marks recursion depth; `pos` is the index being read at the
moment of the call:

```text
evaluate() reads tokens[4] = "*"  -> operator, recurse right then left
  right = evaluate() reads tokens[3] = "3"  -> number, returns 3
  left  = evaluate() reads tokens[2] = "+"  -> operator, recurse right then left
            right = evaluate() reads tokens[1] = "1"  -> number, returns 1
            left  = evaluate() reads tokens[0] = "2"  -> number, returns 2
          "+": left=2, right=1  => returns 2 + 1 = 3
  "*": left=3, right=3  => returns 3 * 3 = 9
```

Reading it from the deepest calls upward: the inner `+` combines `left=2` with
`right=1` to give `3`, then the outer `*` combines `left=3` (that result) with
`right=3` to give `9`. The outermost `evaluate` returns `9`, which matches the
example's expected Output of `9`.

Notice that `right` is resolved before `left`: because we walk leftward, the
token nearest each operator (`3` for the `*`, `1` for the `+`) is its right
operand, exactly the post-order order the tree was flattened into.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's call tree written down: read a token, recurse
into `right` then `left`, and combine.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        operators = {'+', '-', '*', '/'}
        # Scan right to left: the last token is always the outermost operator
        pos = len(tokens) - 1

        def evaluate() -> int:
            nonlocal pos
            token = tokens[pos]
            pos -= 1
            if token not in operators:
                return int(token)
            # The token just before an operator closes its right operand;
            # whatever precedes that is the left operand
            right = evaluate()
            left = evaluate()
            if token == '+':
                return left + right
            if token == '-':
                return left - right
            if token == '*':
                return left * right
            # int() truncates toward zero, matching the spec, unlike Python's
            # // which floors toward negative infinity
            return int(left / right)

        return evaluate()
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Each of the `n` tokens triggers exactly one `evaluate` call doing constant work,
so the traversal is linear.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The recursion depth equals the height of the expression tree, which can reach
`O(n)` for a deeply nested expression (for example, a long chain of operators
each combining a number with the previous result).

#### Key Insights

- RPN is post-order, so the rightmost token is the root and the tree can be
  rebuilt by scanning right to left.
- Recursing into the `right` operand before the `left` is mandatory, since the
  operand adjacent to the operator is its right child.
- This derives the answer straight from the expression's structure without ever
  naming a stack, making it the most intuitive starting point.
- The recursion itself plays the role the explicit stack fills in the iterative
  versions; the call stack holds the pending operands.

### Stack

#### Derivation

The recursion above leans on the call stack, and its depth grows with the
nesting of the expression: a long chain of operators drives it to `O(n)`
levels, which brushes against Python's default recursion limit at the `10^4`
token constraint. The repair is to scan in the other direction and hold the
pending operands ourselves. Reverse Polish Notation places each operator
immediately after its two operands, which is exactly the order a
[stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) consumes:
scanning left to right, we push operands and, on seeing an operator, pop the
two most recent values, combine them, and push the result back.

1. Initialize an empty `stack` and a set of the four operator symbols.
2. For each `token`, if it is an operator, pop `right` then `left` (this order
   matters for `-` and `/`, which are not commutative).
3. Apply the operator to `left` and `right` and push the result.
4. For division, use `int(left / right)` so the quotient truncates toward zero
   as the problem requires.
5. If the token is a number, convert it with `int(token)` and push it.
6. After processing every token, the single remaining value on the stack is the
   answer.

The pop order is the subtle point: because `left` was pushed before `right`, the
first pop yields `right`. Reversing this would compute `right - left` and
`right / left`, which is wrong for the non-commutative operators.

#### Walkthrough

Let us run the scan on Example 2: `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`. Each line
shows the token processed and the `stack` afterward; numbers are pushed as they
arrive, and each operator pops `right` then `left`:

```text
token "4"     push 4                              stack [4]
token "13"    push 13                             stack [4, 13]
token "5"     push 5                              stack [4, 13, 5]
token "/"     right=5, left=13, int(13 / 5) = 2   stack [4, 2]
token "+"     right=2, left=4, 4 + 2 = 6          stack [6]
```

The `/` step shows both subtleties at once: the first pop yields `right = 5`
and the second `left = 13` (popping in the other order would compute `5 / 13`),
and `int(13 / 5)` truncates `2.6` toward zero to give `2`. The final `+` folds
the stack down to a single value, and `stack[-1] = 6` matches the expected
Output `6`.

#### Solution

The code is the walkthrough's loop: push numbers, and on an operator pop
`right`, pop `left`, push the combination.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        operators = {'+', '-', '*', '/'}

        for token in tokens:
            if token in operators:
                # Operands were pushed in order, so the second popped value
                # is the left-hand side of the operation
                right = stack.pop()
                left = stack.pop()
                if token == '+':
                    stack.append(left + right)
                elif token == '-':
                    stack.append(left - right)
                elif token == '*':
                    stack.append(left * right)
                else:
                    # int() truncates toward zero, matching the spec, unlike
                    # Python's // which floors toward negative infinity
                    stack.append(int(left / right))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))

        return stack[-1]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Each of the `n` tokens is processed once, and every stack push and pop is `O(1)`.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

In the worst case (a long run of operands before any operator), the stack holds
on the order of `n` values.

#### Key Insights

- RPN eliminates the need for parentheses and precedence rules; a stack consumes
  operands and operators in exactly the right order.
- Popping yields `right` before `left`, so respecting that order is essential for
  the non-commutative `-` and `/`.
- Python's `//` floors toward negative infinity, so `int(a / b)` is required to
  truncate toward zero (for example, `6 / -132` must give `0`, not `-1`).
- A single pass with constant work per token makes the evaluation linear.

### Operator Dispatch Table

#### Derivation

The stack scan is already linear; what remains awkward is the four-way
`if`/`elif` chain, which restates the same pop-combine-push shape once per
operator and must grow by another branch for every new symbol. The operator
choice is data, not control flow, so this is the same
[stack-based evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)),
but with the branch chain replaced by a dictionary that maps each operator
symbol to the function that applies it. The scan logic becomes uniform: every
operator is handled by one lookup and one call.

1. Build a `operations` table mapping each symbol to a binary function.
   Addition, subtraction, and multiplication come straight from the `operator`
   module; division uses a small lambda wrapping `int(left / right)` so the
   quotient truncates toward zero.
2. Initialize an empty `stack`.
3. For each `token`, if it is a key in `operations`, pop `right` then `left`,
   apply `operations[token](left, right)`, and push the result.
4. Otherwise convert the token with `int(token)` and push it.
5. Return the final value left on the stack.

The pop order (`right` first, then `left`) is identical to the explicit version
and is still essential for the non-commutative `-` and `/`.

#### Walkthrough

Let us run the table-driven scan on Example 3:
`tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`. Each line
shows the token, the lookup-and-call an operator triggers, and the `stack`
afterward:

```text
token "10"    push 10                            stack [10]
token "6"     push 6                             stack [10, 6]
token "9"     push 9                             stack [10, 6, 9]
token "3"     push 3                             stack [10, 6, 9, 3]
token "+"     operations["+"](9, 3) = 12         stack [10, 6, 12]
token "-11"   push -11                           stack [10, 6, 12, -11]
token "*"     operations["*"](12, -11) = -132    stack [10, 6, -132]
token "/"     operations["/"](6, -132) = 0       stack [10, 0]
token "*"     operations["*"](10, 0) = 0         stack [0]
token "17"    push 17                            stack [0, 17]
token "+"     operations["+"](0, 17) = 17        stack [17]
token "5"     push 5                             stack [17, 5]
token "+"     operations["+"](17, 5) = 22        stack [22]
```

The `/` step is why the lambda exists: `int(6 / -132)` truncates `-0.045...`
toward zero to give `0`, where floor division `6 // -132` would give `-1` and
derail every step after it. The scan ends with `stack[-1] = 22`, matching the
expected Output `22`.

#### Solution

The code is the same scan as before with the branch chain replaced by the
`operations` lookup from the walkthrough.

```python
import operator
from typing import Callable, Dict, List


class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        operations: Dict[str, Callable[[int, int], int]] = {
            '+': operator.add,
            '-': operator.sub,
            '*': operator.mul,
            # int() truncates toward zero, unlike // which floors
            '/': lambda left, right: int(left / right),
        }

        stack = []
        for token in tokens:
            if token in operations:
                right = stack.pop()
                left = stack.pop()
                stack.append(operations[token](left, right))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))

        return stack[-1]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity: `O(n)`

Each of the `n` tokens is processed once. A dictionary lookup and a function
call are both `O(1)`, so the work per token is constant.

##### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

The dispatch table holds a fixed four entries, which is `O(1)`, but the stack
can still grow to hold on the order of `n` operands, so overall auxiliary space
is `O(n)`.

#### Key Insights

- A dispatch table trades a branch chain for a single lookup, keeping the loop
  body uniform and easy to extend with new operators.
- Using `operator.add`, `operator.sub`, and `operator.mul` avoids hand-written
  lambdas for the commutative operations while keeping the code compact.
- Division still needs the explicit `int(left / right)` wrapper because the
  truncation-toward-zero rule is not what `//` provides.
- The membership test `token in operations` doubles as the operator check, so no
  separate operator set is required.

## Comparison of Solutions

### Time Complexity

- **Recursive Evaluation**: `O(n)` - each token drives one recursive call doing
  constant work.
- **Stack**: `O(n)` - one pass, constant work per token.
- **Operator Dispatch Table**: `O(n)` - one pass, constant lookup and call per
  token.

### Space Complexity

- **Recursive Evaluation**: `O(n)` - the recursion can reach a depth proportional
  to the expression-tree height, up to `n`.
- **Stack**: `O(n)` - the operand stack can hold up to `n` values.
- **Operator Dispatch Table**: `O(n)` - same operand stack, plus a fixed-size
  table that is `O(1)`.

### Trade-offs

- The Recursive Evaluation approach derives the answer directly from the
  expression's post-order structure with no explicit stack, but trades an
  iterative loop for recursion that can reach `O(n)` depth on deeply nested
  input.
- The Stack approach spells out each operator inline, which is maximally explicit
  and needs no imports, at the cost of a repetitive `if`/`elif` chain.
- The Operator Dispatch Table approach centralizes operator handling in one data
  structure, making the loop shorter and new operators trivial to add, at the
  cost of an extra import and a small amount of indirection.

### When to Use Each

- **Recursive Evaluation**: When you want to reason about RPN as an expression
  tree from first principles, or to make the post-order structure explicit
  without introducing a stack.
- **Stack**: When you want the most self-evident, dependency-free iterative
  implementation, or in an interview where writing out the branches makes the
  truncation detail obvious to the reader.
- **Operator Dispatch Table**: When the operator set might grow, or when you
  prefer a uniform loop body that separates the "what to do" table from the "how
  to scan" logic.

### Optimization Notes

- All three approaches are already linear and optimal for this problem; the
  differences are purely structural.
- Prefer the iterative Stack over the Recursive Evaluation for the upper
  constraint of `10^4` tokens, where a deeply nested expression could otherwise
  approach Python's default recursion limit.
- Keep the division wrapped in `int(left / right)` in either version; replacing
  it with `left // right` silently breaks cases where exactly one operand is
  negative (for example, `7 / -2` must give `-3`, not `-4`).
- Reading `stack[-1]` (the top) rather than `stack[0]` returns the final result
  even if defensive code leaves stray values below it; for a valid RPN
  expression the stack ends with exactly one element.
