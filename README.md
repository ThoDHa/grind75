# LeetCode Grind75 Study Guide

This repository is a structured study guide for algorithmic problem-solving based on the popular [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) list of LeetCode questions developed by the team at [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/). All credit for the curated problem list goes to them for their excellent work in creating this focused interview preparation resource.

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive personal reference where you can:

As you work through each problem, document your solutions, optimizations, and insights. This creates a personalized study resource that helps reinforce your understanding of algorithms and data structures while preparing you for technical interviews.

## Creating a PDF with Pandoc

You can generate a compiled PDF of these problems using the included configuration:

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) - universal document converter
   - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install pandoc`
   - On macOS: `brew install pandoc`
2. Install [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) distribution (like TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
   - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-plain-generic`
   - On macOS: `brew install --cask mactex`
3. Make sure all markdown files referenced in `grind75.yaml` exist in your directory

### Generating the PDF

Run the following command from the terminal in your project directory:

```bash
pandoc --defaults grind75.yaml
```

This will:

- Read configuration from `grind75.yaml`
- Combine the specified markdown files (`two_sum.md`, `valid_parentheses.md`, etc.)
- Create a table of contents
- Generate a PDF file named `grind75.pdf` using the XeLaTeX engine

To customize the output, edit the `grind75.yaml` file. You can add more input files, change metadata, adjust the table of contents, or modify the PDF engine settings.
