# [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Easy - 15 minutes - Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`

**Output:** `3`

### Example 2

**Input:** `root = [1,null,2]`

**Output:** `2`

### Example 3

**Input:** `root = []`

**Output:** `0`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
