# [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Easy - 20 minutes - Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the **diameter** of the tree.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Examples

### Example 1

![Diameter of Binary Tree Example](assets/diameter_of_binary_tree_example1.jpg)

**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,4,5]`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** The length of the diameter from node 4 to node 3 is 3.

### Example 2

**Input:** `root = [1,2]`

**Output:** `1`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
