"""Task Scheduler — https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/task_scheduler.md

Given a list of CPU `tasks` (uppercase letters) and a cooldown `n`, return the
least number of time units needed so that any two identical tasks are separated
by at least `n` units, idling when no task is available.

  uv run python task_scheduler/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest task_scheduler/              # run the test sets
