"""Minimum Height Trees — https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/minimum_height_trees.md

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled `0..n-1` and its `n - 1` undirected edges,
return the labels of every root that yields a tree of minimum height. Answer may
be returned in any order.
