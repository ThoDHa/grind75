"""Subsets — https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/subsets.md

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, return all possible subsets
(the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets, and may be
returned in any order.

  uv run python subsets/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest subsets/                # run the test sets
