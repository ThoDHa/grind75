"""Rotting Oranges — https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/rotting_oranges.md

Given an `m x n` grid of cells (`0` empty, `1` fresh, `2` rotten), each minute
every fresh orange 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten one rots. Return the
minimum minutes until no fresh orange remains, or `-1` if some never rot.

  uv run pytest rotting_oranges/                # run the test sets

            create a queue of all the rotton oranges, then go through the queue everytime.
            we can create two queues? and just cylcle, that's weird.


            we can do the same thing with the number of islands thing, where we go through and spread out every time.
            either keep track of fresh oranges, and at the end we will return back if fresh oranges is 0 etc.
