"""Rotting Oranges — https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/rotting_oranges.md

Given an `m x n` grid of cells (`0` empty, `1` fresh, `2` rotten), each minute
every fresh orange 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten one rots. Return the
minimum minutes until no fresh orange remains, or `-1` if some never rot.

  uv run pytest rotting_oranges/                # run the test sets
