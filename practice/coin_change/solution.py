"""Coin Change — https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/coin_change.md

Given an integer array `coins` of different denominations and an integer
`amount`, return the fewest number of coins needed to make up that amount, or
`-1` if it cannot be made. You have an infinite supply of each coin.
