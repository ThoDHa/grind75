"""Time Based Key-Value Store — https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/time_based_key_value_store.md

Design a TimeMap that stores multiple values for the same key at different
timestamps; `get(key, t)` returns the value with the largest timestamp `<= t`
(or `""` if none). Timestamps passed to `set` are strictly increasing.
