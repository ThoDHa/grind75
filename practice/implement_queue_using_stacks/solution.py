"""Implement Queue using Stacks — https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/implement_queue_using_stacks.md

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The queue
must support `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty` using only standard stack
operations (push to top, peek/pop from top, size, is empty).

  uv run python implement_queue_using_stacks/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest implement_queue_using_stacks/                # run the test sets
