"""Tests for Implement Queue using Stacks — your attempt (solution.py).

Each case is a LeetCode design-operation sequence: an `operations` list (first
entry is the constructor), an `arguments` list aligned with it, and the
`expected` results. `run_operations` drives the MyQueue class and the results
are compared against `expected`. The worked approaches live in
../../docs/problems/implement_queue_using_stacks.md.
