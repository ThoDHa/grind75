"""Combination Sum — https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/combination_sum.md

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`,
return all unique combinations of `candidates` whose numbers sum to `target`. The
same number may be reused an unlimited number of times. Combinations may be
returned in any order.
