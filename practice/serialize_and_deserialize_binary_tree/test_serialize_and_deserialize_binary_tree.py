"""Tests for Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree — your attempt (solution.py).

Each case stores a binary tree as a level-order array. The contract is a
round-trip: serialize the tree to a string, deserialize it back, and confirm the
restored tree matches the original array. cases.json (marker `simple`) is the
"Run" set; cases_full.json (marker `full`) is the "Submit" gauntlet. The worked
approaches live in ../../docs/problems/serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree.md.
