"""Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree — https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree.md

Design a codec that serializes a binary tree to a string and deserializes that
string back into the identical tree (the round-trip must reproduce the tree).

  uv run python serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest serialize_and_deserialize_binary_tree/              # run the test sets
