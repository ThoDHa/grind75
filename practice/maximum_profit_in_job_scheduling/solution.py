"""Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling — https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/maximum_profit_in_job_scheduling.md

Given `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays describing `n` jobs, return the
maximum profit obtainable from a subset of non-overlapping jobs (a job ending at
time `X` may be followed by another starting at `X`).
