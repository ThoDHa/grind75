"""Validate Binary Search Tree — https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/validate_binary_search_tree.md

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine whether it is a valid binary search
tree: every node's value must exceed all values in its left subtree and be less
than all values in its right subtree, recursively.

  uv run python validate_binary_search_tree/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest validate_binary_search_tree/              # run the test sets
