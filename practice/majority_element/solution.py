"""Majority Element — https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/majority_element.md

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element — the element that
appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume it always exists.

  uv run python majority_element/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest majority_element/              # run the test sets
