"""Two Sum — https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/two_sum.md

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to `target`. Exactly one solution exists; you
may not reuse an element. Return the answer in any order.

  uv run python two_sum/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest two_sum/                # run the test sets
