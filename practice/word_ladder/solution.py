"""Word Ladder — https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/word_ladder.md

Given `beginWord`, `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the number of
words in the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`
(changing one letter at a time, each intermediate word in `wordList`), or `0` if
no such sequence exists.
