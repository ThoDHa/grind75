"""3Sum — https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/3sum.md

Given an integer array `nums`, return all unique triplets
`[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` with distinct indices such that they sum to zero.
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets; order does not matter.

  uv run python 3sum/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest 3sum/                # run the test sets
