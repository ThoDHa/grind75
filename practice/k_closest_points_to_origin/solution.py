"""K Closest Points to Origin — https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/k_closest_points_to_origin.md

Given an array of points `points[i] = [xi, yi]` and an integer `k`, return the
`k` points closest to the origin `(0, 0)` by Euclidean distance, in any order.

            What do I want to do?
            create a new list, and keep on finding the closest one and then once I get k items
            That's the brute force solution.


            Maxheap, where you use the minimum heap of the python library, where we add till k items
            then start doing replace. heapq, it's a max heap so how do you turn it to a min heap?


            QuickSelect, just uses the a partial quick sort, to sort the first k elements, but how?
            Only do left side if mid is less then k, then right if mid is greater than k.
            it keeps on sorting, till mid mid is k, then it's it.

            Just use built sorting algorithm.
