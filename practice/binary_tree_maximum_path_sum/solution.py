"""Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum — https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/binary_tree_maximum_path_sum.md

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty
path. A path is a sequence of nodes connected by edges, each node used at most
once, and it need not pass through the root.
