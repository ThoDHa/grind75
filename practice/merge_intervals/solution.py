"""Merge Intervals — https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/merge_intervals.md

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all
overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that
cover all the intervals in the input. The answer may be returned in any order.
