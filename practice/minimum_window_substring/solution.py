"""Minimum Window Substring — https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/minimum_window_substring.md

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the shortest substring of `s` that contains
every character of `t` (including duplicates), or `""` if no such window exists.

  uv run python minimum_window_substring/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
