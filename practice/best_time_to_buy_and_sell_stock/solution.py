Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.md

Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the stock price on day `i`, choose a
single day to buy and a later day to sell to maximize profit. Return the maximum
profit achievable, or `0` if no profitable transaction exists.
