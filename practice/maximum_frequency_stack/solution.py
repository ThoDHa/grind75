"""Maximum Frequency Stack — https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/maximum_frequency_stack.md

Design a stack-like structure: push elements, and pop the most frequent element.
If several elements share the highest frequency, pop the one pushed most recently.
