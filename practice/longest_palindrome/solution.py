"""Longest Palindrome — https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/longest_palindrome.md

Given a string `s` of lowercase and/or uppercase letters, return the length of
the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters. Letters are case
sensitive, so "Aa" is not a palindrome here.

  uv run python longest_palindrome/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest longest_palindrome/                # run the test sets
