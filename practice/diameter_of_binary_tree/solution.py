"""Diameter of Binary Tree — https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/diameter_of_binary_tree.md

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree:
the number of edges on the longest path between any two nodes, which may or may
not pass through the root.
