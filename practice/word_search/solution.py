"""Word Search — https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/word_search.md

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `True` if
`word` can be spelled out by a path of horizontally/vertically adjacent cells,
using each cell at most once.
