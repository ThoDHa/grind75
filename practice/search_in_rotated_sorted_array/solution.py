"""Search in Rotated Sorted Array — https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/search_in_rotated_sorted_array.md

An ascending array of distinct values is rotated at an unknown pivot. Given the
rotated `nums` and a `target`, return the index of `target`, or `-1` if it is
absent. The algorithm must run in `O(log n)` time.

  uv run python search_in_rotated_sorted_array/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest search_in_rotated_sorted_array/              # run the test sets
