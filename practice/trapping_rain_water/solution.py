"""Trapping Rain Water — https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/trapping_rain_water.md

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of
each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

  uv run python trapping_rain_water/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest trapping_rain_water/                # run the test sets
