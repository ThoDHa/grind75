"""Binary Search — https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/binary_search.md

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order and an integer
`target`, return the index of `target` in `nums`, or -1 if it is absent. The
algorithm must run in `O(log n)` time.
