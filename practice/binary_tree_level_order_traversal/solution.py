"""Binary Tree Level Order Traversal — https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/binary_tree_level_order_traversal.md

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes'
values (from left to right, level by level).
