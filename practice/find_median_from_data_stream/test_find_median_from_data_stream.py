"""Tests for Find Median from Data Stream — your attempt (solution.py) against both case sets.

Each case is a LeetCode design-operation sequence (operations + arguments) that
is replayed against your MedianFinder via run_operations. cases.json (marker
`simple`) is the "Run" set; cases_full.json (marker `full`) is the "Submit"
gauntlet. The worked approaches live in ../../docs/problems/find_median_from_data_stream.md.
