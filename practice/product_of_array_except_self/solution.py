"""Product of Array Except Self — https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/product_of_array_except_self.md

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is
the product of all elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. Solve it in `O(n)` time
without using division.
