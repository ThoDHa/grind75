"""Tests for Accounts Merge — your attempt (solution.py) against both case sets.

cases.json (marker `simple`) is the "Run" set; cases_full.json (marker `full`) is
the "Submit" gauntlet. Answer order is not fixed, so both sides are canonicalized
(emails sorted within each account, then accounts sorted) before comparing. The
worked approaches live in ../../docs/problems/accounts_merge.md.
