"""Accounts Merge — https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/accounts_merge.md

Given a list of accounts where each `accounts[i]` is `[name, email1, email2, ...]`,
merge accounts that share any common email and return each merged account as the
name followed by its emails in sorted order (accounts in any order).

  uv run python accounts_merge/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest accounts_merge/                # run the test sets
