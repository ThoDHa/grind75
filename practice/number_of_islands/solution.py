"""Number of Islands — https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/number_of_islands.md

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the
number of islands. An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally
or vertically and is surrounded by water.
