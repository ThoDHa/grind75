"""Tests for Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree — your attempt (solution.py).

Trees are stored in the case files as level-order value arrays plus the `p` and
`q` target values; they are marshalled to TreeNodes here, and the target nodes are
located by value before calling lowestCommonAncestor. The worked approaches live
in ../../docs/problems/lowest_common_ancestor_of_a_binary_tree.md.
