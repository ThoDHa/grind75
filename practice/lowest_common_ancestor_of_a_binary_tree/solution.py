"""Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree — https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/lowest_common_ancestor_of_a_binary_tree.md

Given a binary tree and two nodes `p` and `q`, return their lowest common
ancestor: the deepest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (a node may
be a descendant of itself).
