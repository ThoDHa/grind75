"""Course Schedule — https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/course_schedule.md

There are `numCourses` courses labeled `0` to `numCourses - 1`. Each pair
`prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` means course `b` must be taken before course `a`.
Return `True` if you can finish every course, otherwise `False`.
