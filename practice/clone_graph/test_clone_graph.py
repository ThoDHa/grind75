"""Tests for Clone Graph — your attempt (solution.py) against both case sets.

Graphs are stored in the case files as LeetCode adjacency lists (1-indexed) and
marshalled to GraphNode here. The cloned graph is serialized back to an adjacency
list for comparison. The worked approaches live in ../../docs/problems/clone_graph.md.
