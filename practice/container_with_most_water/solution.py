"""Container With Most Water — https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/container_with_most_water.md

Given an integer array `height` of `n` vertical lines, find two lines that with
the x-axis form a container holding the most water, and return that maximum area.

  uv run python container_with_most_water/solution.py     # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest container_with_most_water/                # run the test sets
