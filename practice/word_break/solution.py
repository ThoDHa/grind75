"""Word Break — https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/word_break.md

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `True` if `s`
can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary
words. The same word may be reused multiple times.
