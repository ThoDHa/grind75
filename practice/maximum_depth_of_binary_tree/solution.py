"""Maximum Depth of Binary Tree — https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/maximum_depth_of_binary_tree.md

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth (the number of nodes
along the longest path from the root down to the farthest leaf).

  uv run python maximum_depth_of_binary_tree/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
